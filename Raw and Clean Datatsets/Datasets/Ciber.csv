The new management and leads are very biased. They have favorites and micromanage everyone else. Favorites take 2 hour lunches while everyone else is micromanaged, even when doing a great job Also, management does not have your back at all. If you make a complaint they will advise that they will check into things but will not really. If someone says something about you though and you have proof it isn't true, they will pretend it is and will not check or investigate anything. Lastly, many of the new leads are not qualified to be leads, they were friends of the new management before and he brought them up when he was promoted. They have not been trained and don't speak to workers with much respect and do not assist when needed. This new environment makes everyone uncomfortable, but does not make anyone more productive. There is now an us vs them environment in place with regard to management and workers. Many of the new leads need training. They don't know that speaking to people with respect goes a long way. They think being in management means just bossing people around but they are not very supportive.

Sat Feb 17 2018 04:31:36 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Principal Consultant,"Orlando, FL",Former Employee ,STAY AWAY - you can probably do better (at least in Orlando),I worked at Ciber full-time for more than 5 years,"You can work here to get experience. You are left alone as long as your client sponsor doesn’t complain - basically if you are decent and want to just hide out and get paid reasonable this is a good place. You aren’t really a “consultant” like they tell you - clients/sponsors don’t care what you think (usually). Ciber is really a staff augmentation firm - nothing wrong with it just don’t get delusions based on an inflated title. I worked here for 5 years and bounced around, got good assignments for my resume to land a real career job. They toss you $50 visa gift cards from time to time to say “thank you” and they will pay towards your mobile phone bill if you press for it. Some people may like that Ciber employees are allowed to have beer and cocktails while on the Client clock during business hours as long as the Client isn’t aware, doesn’t complain, or is with you while you consume. I personally do not approve but listed as a pro as there are different opinions on this topic.","No growth or promotion opportunity. I was passed over for a “secret” unposted promotion (the 2nd of such made available in the 5 years I worked there) and told “it wasn’t local management choice who was promoted, everyone was selected by corporate” so I received no feedback to improve. No clue what the people promoted did differently from me. Side Note: I suppose promotions aren’t real at Ciber anyway as you can title yourself whatever you want in your signature blocks and notify parties of the new role you just made up. Worked with a BA who fancied/titled herself a “Delivery Manager” and told select individuals she was now suddenly their superior over them “and 40 other people.” Another example was a BA who decided to change her title to “Project Manager” and informed her real Project Manager, the Client, and project team members. Yet a third example is a Project Manager who told me she was my superior and I had to begin working through her for Ciber-related questions and concerns and that now I needed to schedule weekly 1:1 touchpoints with her. None of these examples were actually true per my confirmations with Ciber corporate. Zero consequences from Ciber for any of these individuals and they were admittedly permitted to keep and communicate out their made-up titles and false “claims of superiority” over people “to not disturb the Client relationship.” Frankly immature, absurd behavior and unprofessional all the way around. Imagine the confusion, embarrassment, and liability to be working with these individuals knowing Ciber supports this type of nonsense. There’s a suprising number of these examples - far more than just these 3. Not everyone understands these are simply creative individuals who landed at a company oddly willing to support their fantasies. No employee performance review process. Client/Sponsors are permitted to work you 50+ hours every week (not every once in a while, every week) and to give you horrid lowest-level assignments (such as proofreading for weeks at a time). Nothing is done to protect you from this type of abuse - you’re stuck until assignment ends or you resign. Basically there’s a risk of expansive black holes your resume where you aren’t doing activities relevant to your profession. No overtime, expected minimum work week is 50+ hours. Ciber doesn’t respond to employment verification requests. Not a huge deal, but know this if you ever buy a house or start exploring other opportunities. Don’t give notice - I was called and told to not come in after giving notice (cut off insurance and pay same day) under “employment at will.” Wasn’t under any kind of performance plan, was repeatedly told “everything is great they love you.” There’s no bench time to bridge you between assignments. Don’t believe what they tell you about this. You will be let go if you aren’t picked up - you are really more like a contracter with a W2 instead of a 1099. Even with this huge risk you don’t get paid over 40 hours - ever. Ciber will allow poor employees to linger as long as a client is willing to pay for them: A Ciber employee was harassed and called “racist” by another Ciber employee to the extent of she was leaving articles on her desk and sending her “reasons why you’re racist” via Facebook. Even scheduled a meeting to sit us all down to explain why the other employee was racist. Just unbelievable actions that were all reported. The victim (and the rest of us) were told to tolerate this behavior and “work it out” with the other Ciber employee to “not disturb the relationship with the client.” 5 years of service and my only 2 pay raises received I had to either resign and receive as a counter offer or demand and fight for. When you leave, vacation isn’t paid out and if you “owe” it comes out of final paycheck. Speaking of vacation, don’t expect much. You have to burn PTO on days your client is closed if Ciber doesn’t recognize the holiday. With only 6 paid holidays from Ciber, this means burning a lot of your measly 10 days - even burning before you earn them is beyond your control. Benefits have been consistently cut over past 3 years - insurance and programs aren’t great but could possibly save you from bankruptcy if your appendix explodes. 401K - not worth even mentioning really: 50% match up to 6% of your salary or it caps at a couple thousand. FIVE year vesting. Because drinking alcohol during business hours while on the clock is permitted and frequently done by some employees, I’m concerned that safety isn’t a top priority for employees of both Ciber and Ciber Clients.","2.0

The company is attempting to get into the ‘Staffing’ business, with not a clue what they are doing and trying to compete with the big boys; Accenture, Kelly etc. They don’t seem to understand that it’s relationships that matter not metrics. If you try to tell them, because God knows you have more experience, you get shut down and put in your corner. Management, ha, they couldn’t manage their way out of a paper bag with a flashlight and a compass..For some ridiculous reason the company promotes people not for leadership skills but because of tenure, while this could have merit if they invested in leadership training, without this, it is a joke. If they would only get rid of the majority of the C-Suite and pretty much all the middle management they could afford to keep the people who are actually talented and could help the company survive. However, due to ridiculous nepotism and other reasons they don’t. For example the CEO, if he were let go before June this year, he would get a ‘golden parachute’ why is that, normal folks don’t get paid to leave, why do CEO’s..so you suck at your job, hey here’s money to go ruin another company??

When traveling they only allow you $40 a day per diem. If you exceed that you catch grief from management. They recently implemented an unlimited vacation policy. Sounds great right? But what they really did was eliminate a valuable vacation cash out policy you could use if you didn't use all of your earned vacation.

People are generally nice and friendly. Some of the PMs on the open source team work well with developers. There are lots of good opportunities to learn new and valuable skills. This would be a great job for someone just out of college looking to add experience to a resume. Two years here will make you an attractive candidate elsewhere. There are even occasional training opportunities for useful technologies that are doled out in limited amounts based on how management feels about you at the time. Some of these opportunities would be very expensive to pursue out of your own pocket and others simply wouldn't be available at all. When the workload is slow, there is a general attitude of ""just get the work done"" and things like working from home are permitted with relatively little pushback. It is common for employees to take very long lunch hours around these times too, over an hour, without anyone seeming to notice or care. During particularly slow times, you will be put on the bench, meaning you have nothing billable but they don't lay you off which is nice. They ask you to pursue training and whatnot, but most people just sit around watching youtube or netflix during this time. As long as you make an effort to ask about helping others once or twice a day, you are pretty much free to do what you want short of breaking any rules or being noisy. You can develop good camaraderie with a few of the employees and will make some good friends if you want to. A couple of the most senior developers are excellent sources of information and will make a difference in your approaches to coding if you take their advice to heart.","Where to start? Upper management is dishonest and uninterested in employee happiness. When work loads get heavy, the approach is to intentionally lowball contracts and then expect employees to work 60 to 80 hour weeks and weekends to meet unrealistic deadlines. These hours are not compensated in any way. After a few weeks of it, you might get a comp day if you are lucky. That's it. Developers are seldom asked for their input on timelines and routinely ignored when they express concern. When a personal scheduling conflict arises that prevents you from working until 1 AM, expect to be openly shamed at work the next day for not being a team player. Literally you will be asked to work until 1 or 2 am for days at a time at some point and if you call it a night at 12 one day, you will be called out in front of everyone the next day. Many of the PMs on the open source team are difficult to work with. Communication is poor and developers are treated like tools instead of people. Developers are left in the dark a lot and thrown curveballs in terms of work expectations. Management tries to be your friend to earn your trust and then misleads you. A couple of the PMs are liable to throw developers under the bus to make excuses for their own mistakes. On the .NET team, the problem is the opposite. Everything is micromanaged to the extreme. The whole team is handcuffed to agile approaches even when they don't make sense; you will spend more time in meetings than actually working. This doesn't change even when deadlines are rapidly approaching. You'll be expected to spend hours in meetings and work late instead of just working during normal hours. Despite being asked to always point out ways you think the work process could be made more efficient, bringing up this point out of concern will get your outright punished for questioning your boss. This despite the fact that end of year evals explicitly list this as a responsibility employees should strive to meet. Some of the PMs are dishonest and very passive aggressive. Lots of politicking goes on behind the scenes. PMs act like they are better than developers and treat them like children. Some of these developers are in the 40's and 50's and having been working longer than some of these PMs have been alive. Serious lack of respect. All of the above might be tolerable except for the fact that you also will never get a raise. Not cost of living, not merit based, nothing. You can work at Ciber for 5 years and you will make exactly what you were hired at. As a matter of policy, raises are not given, ostensibly because the company overall can't turn a profit. Once or twice a year someone from way up high in the organization will show up in their expensive suit and blow smoke about Ciber's efforts to change culture and how they will change this policy as soon as the company becomes profitable, but then the next thing you know that person was fired. Promotions aren't much better, you might get another word added to your title if you let them abuse you enough, but it's meaningless and all real senior positions are filled from outside the company. Even promotions don't come with raises, and if you ask for a raise you will simply be refused and given a meager excuse. Bonuses are a joke. Every year you are supposed to get a bonus based on merit. However, your bonus is cut based on other departments' lack of performance. In other words, they take money out of your bonus because people somewhere else in another city underperform. You have no control over this. They go out of their way to tell you how much they were going to pay you and how much they kept instead. Everything else being the same, it seems like it would be smarter to just give you a lower number to start with instead of acting like you were going to get more and then snatching it away at the last minute.","2.0

Phila was one of Cibers most profitable areas. We all worked hard but knew that the hard work would be financially rewarded. Several years ago, the company changed how they work and now the $$ earned must just go to the top people, because we don't see it in the field. Now the 401K match is low; very few, if any, salary increases; bonuses are minimal; just took away all Paid Time off and are giving us ""unlimited vacation"" which is a joke because you are too busy at a client to take the time but now Ciber doesn't need to do a cash payout if you don't take vacation, so that $$ must go to the top people as well.","2.0

Benefits are awful: minimum small company annual contributions to 401 (K) with heavy-handed vesting conditions, life insurance reduced from two times salary to 1 time a salary, upon loss of job the consultant loses 1/3 of value of unused PTO (they say that it is to compensate for sick days -- not too sympathetic as I had zero sick days during my three years with the company). They also disbanded the Employee Council that provided a conduit for feedback to senior management in North America. Their sales organization is extremely weak with the pipeline pretty bare except for Infor and ORACLE lines of business. This leads to a very high turn-over rate, as they have very low tolerance for Bench. In turn, this situation leads to insecurity by the consultants and a paranoia of the Friday afternoon call from a Vice-President (purportedly to ""discuss future projects"" but in reality it is a notification of severance the same day ).....","1.0

This has led to many different offerings and consulting practices that are very thin and depend on the involvement of a few key people. Repeatable processes across the company are rare, so account teams are left to succeed or fail based on their local talents rather than on some larger body of work that has been leveraged across multiple clients. Unfortunately, this results in unpredictable results with client engagements.","3.0

The whole time I was at Ciber (1.5 years) I never felt like I had job security. I think that's one of the biggest problems as an employee you have no guarantee for work and as such no guarantee of staying. While I was there I had 3 practice leads within my first 12 months. There was never any feeling of a cohesive group within our practice. I don't believe we even knew everyone's names. They don't seem like they're open to new ideas and really pushing themselves to stand out. It seemed like in every project we were brought on to do cookie cutter work. I was never encouraged to try and push the envelope at all, which I think for a consulting company is a great way to never stand out. When bringing new ideas and approaches to my superior they constantly shot them down saying ""Ciber is old and doesn't change easily"". Like I said before never really felt like we were a cohesive unit. Also lots of things happen on the back-end that you don't find out till later which is infuriating, esp when they are things that involve you. Training was almost non-existent. I had my skills but I had to suggest cross training to my superiors. One time I even had to explain why it would be beneficial for Ciber to pay for me to take a training course in a very upcoming piece of software (that Ciber is partners with). Be prepared for down time and do as much freelance as you can because you never know when they will let you go. I understand not keeping on dead weight but I believe its the companies responsibility to try to keep their consultants active. If they would encourage cross training or cross department working relationships I think less down time would occur.","2.0

Thu Nov 20 2014 12:13:28 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,, ,A Staffing Company in Sustained Decline,I worked at Ciber,"There are a lot of talented people at Ciber and the benefits are decent. If you are a consultant, you can operate independently and make good money.","Ciber really tries hard to create a vision of being a consulting company, but the reality is that Ciber is largely a staffing company that greatly overvalues the services they offer. On one side, they are fighting a losing battle with larger companies that have much better brand recognition and will provide services at significantly lower prices. On the other side, they are losing to local consulting companies that are much more specialized and actually add value to the services they provide. Revenues are consistently declining at Ciber and Wall Street has taken notice. They are really proud of how they were once a billion dollar company. Those days are long gone and won't be back anytime soon. Ciber lacks a solid long term career path and has no corporate culture. Employees are spread out across the world and many have more real connection to the company they are doing contract work for than Ciber itself. They aren't a company that focuses on core employee values or exceptional client satisfaction. Due to Ciber's nonexistent company culture, consultants feel detached from the company. This leads to high turnover since true consulting companies can be found in any major American market. Collaboration among different groups was nearly impossible at times since Ciber takes talented people and makes them work against other talented people within the company. Very few people at Ciber truly cared about being part of a cohesive team, but rather just making sure they did their job well enough to point the finger in the other direction when things don't go well. The revolving door at Ciber made it difficult to have stable long term leadership across the business. The new CEO is trying to make changes and talks a good game. He has his work cut out for him since there is no corporate identity that opens the door to evolution for Ciber, just new theories on what will drive revenues. Speaking of open doors, don't expect to find many of them at Ciber. My manager consistently wanted to go behind the backs of others and seemed to take pleasure in throwing coworkers and subordinates under the bus. In all frankness, this manager was considerably below Ciber's normal standards, but it shocked me how a publicly traded company let someone into a leadership position that is absolutely clueless about what it takes to be an effective leader, shows no tact toward colleagues, and demonstrates a complete lack of organizational skills. Inferior leadership skills of this nature speak volumes to the sustained downward trending of this company. Overall, the headwinds at this company are very strong and the odds of finding stability are not good. Ciber can be great for some, but others will find that the turbulence far outweighs the benefits.","2.0

Fri Apr 18 2014 04:46:36 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Senior Business Systems Analyst,"Orlando, FL",Former Employee ,Beware of Managed Services,I worked at Ciber full-time for less than a year,Salaries are generally higher than market; decent benefits; excellent training and certification opportunities; co-workers for the most part are good people. In general Ciber is a good company and I would have continued to work there were it not for my experience with Managed Services.,"Managed services (at Disney World) seem to be led by self-centered, egotistical leaders; very cliquish - if you don't belong, don't expect to be treated fairly. Leaders behave as dictators - don't do things their way, you're out; sometimes exhibit petty behavior - indicative of a lack of leadership skills. They also seem to unable to identifiy skilled individuals in thier ranks - give best assignments to those they like best. Some Project Managers treat Business Analysts like subordinates rather than partners - often relegated to clerical duties.","3.0

This prevents existing practices from being able to respond to proposals in a timely manner, and has the consultants working in these practices stretched so thin that new projects won almost always call for recruiters to hire new consultants. It does not look good to clients when the consultant's first day on the job with Ciber is the first day working on the client's project. Recruiters constantly struggle to support the sales team and are pulled off existing opportunities that they are working for the sales team to go help one of the national accounts, thus leaving account executives with positions needing to be filled that nobody is working.","4.0
