Tue Jul 21 2020 17:49:46 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Tenant Research Associate,"Richmond, VA",Current Employee ,DO NOT GET SUCKED FOR THE MONEY!!!,I have been working at CoStar Group full-time for more than 3 years,Pay good benefits coworkers Christmas party great view,"They hate to be the word ""call-center,"" but that's all it is glorified call-center. If you do not like outbound cold calling, please do not consider it. The metrics are unstable and never match the workload. The projects are never thought out thoroughly; thus, they are continually making changes. There is no real growth besides going to a different department with the same duties the only difference is audiences. Diversity and inclusion are only being addressed because of George Floyd, and the CEO has been missing in action but will send out an email of businesses he has acquired. The Vice-president believes she is doing everyone a favor by announcing she has an ""African-American"" on her executive team, thanks (about as equivalent as saying I have a black friend). Due to COVID-19, many businesses are closed or are operating with limited staff, which makes obtaining interview goals impossible, but they add more duties and drill making calls. Management is just as stressed out as their team, which creates uncertainty within the work environment. I am sure the HR team will reply with a fix, but it basically boils down to a monopolizing company that mirrors its leader. I advise any new employees, especially college grads work there for a year before making any significant purchases; there is nothing worst than being stuck at a job you're not happy at because of the excitement of the salary. If you do not have a degree, I feel bad for you! You can be a consistent top performer and have worked there for years and will not get promoted because they are degree driven versus tenure and experience, so they lose many valuable employees. We have a VP that is disconnected from reality that he is unrelatable to the voices of the employees; he rather ignores and makes jokes instead of being a leader that listens.","2.0

Wed Jul 08 2020 05:20:42 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Inside Sales Representative,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,Run. Don't walk away if you have integrity.,I have been working at CoStar Group full-time for more than 3 years,"You get a “base” pay that is lower-middle at best for a company that touts themselves more of a high end blue chip, tech company. I'm told good benefits. We used to have free, processed, boxed salads for lunch at the office. The platform is pretty useful but it doesn't come anywhere close to the stuff you have to vomit out before a client hangs up. They haven't laid off anyone. Yet. Did they lower quotas? No. Did they look at helping in ANY way like most real tech companies did? Not a chance. Did they make it harder to earn a living a month before COVID hit and then leave us on the beach? Of course. *read the advice section* If you don't mind the same thing over and over again, not learn anything new, are a great at stretching the truth, and willing to sell your soul to make a buck, this is the place for you.","Where do I begin and how do I give you the most brutally honest review I can? I guess recruitment is a good place to start. Don’t get it twisted, there is no “base”, you are an hourly employee and treated as such. Your “base” is trash and heaven help you if there is a slow month because living in DC/VA/MD isn’t cheap! Even the “perks” posted like being invited to President’s Club is a bold face lie (HR, I hope you fix your ads!). Admittedly, the original commission structure was very good about 4 years ago (more on that later)… On the surface, they will try to find people fresh out of college to give them an “opportunity”, in reality, it’s because they know anyone who has worked in sales would never take this job. As most too good to be true opportunities start, they will try and lure you in by wowing/flashing you with commission checks from previous sales reps so it all seems real, but what they don’t want you to know is that those successful people had either cheated the system or the structure that was in place was okay because management/shareholders hadn’t dug into your paycheck yet (check out the stock price if you are wondering—pay goes down, price goes up). The other part to it is that they know you have no frame of reference because you just graduated, so these numbers seem amazing for someone who was probably eating ramen and bottom shelf beer a few months ago.. **REMEMBER THAT YOUR COMMISSIONS ARE TAXED AT HIGHER RATES THAN ANY OTHER MONEY STREAMS*** just cut 40% off the top to make the math easy for yourself. There continues to be so much disconnect between HR, Finance, and Management that they find a way to increase the prices to clients while SOMEHOW still figuring out a way to lower your paycheck. A fun ritual that they play is that they bring us all together for a team building exercise, drop a “new and improved” payout plan and then barricade themselves from talking to anyone so you can’t ask them questions. Ex: Newest plan benefited some +1%, but punished most others commissions -9%.... How you will be treated: You are a joke at best and a metric at worst. The fact they call you by your name and not an employee number is a shocker as most managers do not give one flip about clients or their subordinates. After being micromanaged with times (remember, this is an hourly job!), you are given a lousy script to read and if you do not read it verbatim, they will threaten you with write ups and firing you. This is not a sales job. This is showing your ability to pick up the phone and how well you can read. The script isn't awful the first time a client hears it, but, they want you to the say the same words to the same client every 60 days as if it was the last sales rep that was the issue instead of realizing there might be different situations for different people. You get to look at notes seeing that 10 different reps had tried calling within the past two months (I hope you didn't forget about those metrics!) and hoping that they don't pick up only to yell why the company calls so much.. This is partly due to our research team also having insane metrics, the result is the client being bombarded every few days by different people calling. The fun part is getting the sale, but, hold your horses if you think getting paid is easy. You can get a client to sign up, but the policy is that you have to get payment over the phone or you WILL NOT GET PAID. If the client doesn't feel comfortable giving you their payment information via the phone, tough luck, the company will keep the revenue and tell you to kick bricks (and if you think this happens every once in a while, have fun learning the hard way).-- Clients have options to sign up without you and that commission check that you count on so much is a lot lighter when you lose your deal but the company still keeps it all. -- The inside managers have 0 backbone when it comes to defending reps keeping their deals when outside managers/execs come and swoop deals. You will be forced to remember a ton of rules that change every few months in order for more of your deals to be pulled. Leadership made a rule change that required reps wait a few days before helping a hot lead. This was thinly masked as a better client experience (which doesn't even make sense because now the client went on their merry way without realizing the bait and switch for a few days resulting in lost more time), when the obvious truth was that they just wanted more people to sign up online and cut expenses. Did I mention clawbacks are a real thing? If a client doesn't fulfill their full term length or even decides they like the service but they don’t want it to auto renew, you will have that deal pulled from you on your next commission check... EVEN THOUGH you won't see a penny if the client renews their subscriptions. Let's finish with company culture. We had a company meeting where senior leadership finally stopped counting all the money and realized that our name/brand has been dragged through the mud. Was it client services defending policies? No. It was sales reps willing to say anything to get a sale by over promising and under delivering. Everything is transactional selling and the more you can oversell glitchy features and tell them that this will fix all life's problems, the better. How many companies show loyalty to their oldest clients by increasing pricing on clients that have been with us for decades 500%+? Management isn't afraid of saying, ""live with the price increase or we will find someone else who will""... and by not afraid, I mean the finance department thinks it is a good idea and leaves it to the sales reps to deliver the news/take the brunt of the anger... And when the client pulls their business, the rep delivering the bad news will take the reversal on their next commission check. The only time that you will ever interact with finance is when they raise the prices on the services with no notice or when they accidentally give the sales floor a couple extra bucks before Christmas and then take it back on the next paycheck. Happy Holidays! I was going to list career advancement in the pro section, but I have found more people coming back to Loopnet after moving on ""up"" to sell CoStar or flat out quitting. Management wants turnover so they continue to exploit naive, young professionals who have no frame of reference, don't have to support a family, and will leave for better jobs so they can collect on the renewals. The longer you stay, the more you will work for the same to less pay. Feel free to ignore the warnings, but don't say that no one warned you.","1.0

I came on board and everything was good for the first year or so then things went downhill. Quick. You're pretty much working your behind off quarter after quarter for promotions and advancement all for a measly 5% increase. You're asked your opinion and feedback on how things can be made better but are never taken seriously. While change is inevitable and expected, one day you're coming into work on a normal day and next thing you your livelihood is at stake. Layoffs occured in Chicago, Columbia, MD and the DC HQ. When layoffs occurred in Atlanta in 2019, hundreds of people were either expected to pick up their whole lives and move to a whole new state 10 hours away or not have a job and later be picked up by people who don't know what they're doing and are being inadequately trained. Communication and transparency is almost comical and micromanagement is worse than traffic on 285 on a Tuesday. There's next to no job security and even if you think you're safe, your department may be next on the chopping block. And the best excuse they can come up with is ""it was a business decision"". Not sure how a company that's supposed to be so stable and successful is letting go of and disrespecting literally hundreds of hard working people. Growth and opportunity has gone down the drain so unless you're working in sales (who get free Teslas and vacations) or maybe some sort of analyst you're pretty much disregarded and looked down upon. While CoStar is a good stepping stone and introduction to commercial real estate, don't plan on being there for no more than 2 years or 3 max. Favoritism, gossip, being overlooked and upper management having an agenda run rampant. However some managers are good people and some genuinely do care. It's basically a glorified call center where they have your metrics displayed on big screens for everyone to see. The CEO will talk about how great everything is during company meetings but is just trying to shut every other company down or buy them out so he can be the only big shot in town so clients, big or small, will have no choice but to pay astronomical amounts per month to use the product. And you're the one who has to deal with unhappy clients on the phone every day complaining as if you work for Sprint and you do nothing but sit there and take it.","2.0

Once hired on, I quickly realized that it was nothing more than a glorified call center. Within a month's time, I noticed that there weren't any guidelines for our work. Immediate management came up with procedures and processes on the fly. When asking clarifying questions about various methods, they couldn't give answers. C-Suite management imposed unrealistic goals and metrics which ultimately drove the company culture into the ground. It created an environment where other associates began ""gaming"" the system to meet numbers. Management praised those people and scolded those who were conducting business correctly because they didn't meet numbers. Please be aware that your days will not look the same from week to week. C-Suite management has a way of coming up with new ideas and implementing them without test runs or feedback from us. They still expect you to meet numbers regardless. They prioritize quantity over quality. This serves as to why their data is so incomplete and untrustworthy. C-Suite brags to clients that they have the most accurate commercial real estate data and that isn't true. Most associates would input false information just to keep up numbers and refrain from being put on a performance improvement plan. The turnover rates were sky high - management and associates. People caught on to the toxic culture, lack of respect, and micromanaging nature. C-Suite management makes decisions without considering employees and it's evident. The PTO is subpar. Promotions and raises are few, far, and in between. Once they do come around, management chooses their favorites. Tenure doesn't mean a thing at this company. They acquire companies multiple times a year to keep their monopoly persona steady. The CEO is extremely condescending and disrespectful to all levels of employees. He sends out inappropriate emails to the entire company (i.e. who we should vote for, products we should buy, mocking companies he's put out of business, etc.) That was very distasteful.

Medical benefits is fairly decent as well, you only pay $25-40 per pay period. 4% matching 401k and a good company stock option plan. They do provide a good amount of “healthy snacks”. Collaboration is really good, given the time difference from Europe-California. Management has been good with delegating projects across the team.","If you don’t work in any of the major office. (ie DC or Richmond) you can feel left out from your peers. Maybe it’s a good idea to send back your employee to DC or RIC at least once or twice a year. PTO and sick time is just average (market average) or below average (compare to other tech firms), they do give you 2 personal holidays on top of the 12 days. I believe 15+2+5 is the sweet spot for vacation benefits. I do heard that they give some sort of bonus if you do well on a project, But a annual bonus is nice as well. Receiving $300-500 in December is a nice way to show your appreciation to your employees.","4.0

If you are interested in a career in commercial real estate, this is a good place to start for resume recognition but dont get comfortable.","Costar has eliminated the competition in many areas so this has caused Senior leadership to have inflated egos and forget about those who work for them. The changes made to Research have not only caused quality to decrease, it has also led to a micro-management culture. Instead of being the leader in real Estate information, now they are focusing on marketing, which allows them to justify the decrease in quality information. The company just laid off 270 workers in Atlanta and DC. One group in Atlanta wasn't even given notice. They were asked to leave right after they were told. Previous layoffs have been in Chicago in 2016, Norcross, GA in 2015, San Deigo in 2017 and Columbia, MD in 2018. The company will say it's for operational efficiency, however the easiest way to reach the $3 billion dollar profit goal is to reduce the workforce. Please note, if Costar aquires a company, chances are the majority of the employees will be laid off within the following year. Senior leadership doesn't even get along. One of the heads in the Richmond office was overheard telling another manager how she was going to take everything away from another VP and his direct reports. The company also does not fairly pay their employees. Several internal hires are paid extremely less than those in similar positions. The company justifies this by saying 9% increases are standard practice. However this causes $10-20K differences in pay. There is no diversity in Senior leadership and the company does not value it. When racial slurs were left on a conference room whiteboard, the company added 32 cameras to one of two floors in the building. This floor just happened to be predominantly African American and the group given no notice before being let go. No training was done and the person was never found. There are only 2 Directors of color and only 2 females. The CEO has been going to various researchers and paying them for leaving positive reviews on Glassdoor so please take that into consideration if you read them.","2.0

How many true building owners can you find on Google? How good are you at falsifying monthly numbers, because the vast majority of ""researchers"" do so to stay employed? I use quotes because actual research isn't really part of the job- we gather existing data from obvious, predetermined sources and put it in a database. ""Research"" often feels more like customer service. Just don't forget, these numbers determine your worth and not silly things like tenure, intellect or subject matter expertise. Did I mention layoffs in portfolio research? Summer 2018- Columbia, MD office closes, 150+ terminated. Some researchers accepted a transfer to DC.

This is why people call it a trap.","Here’s a summary of this review in case you don’t feel like reading: If you are bored easily, don’t like doing the same few tasks over and over again, have an issue with micromanagement, and want to get some sort of satisfaction out of your work, do not take this job. I worked here for a year and half and like 90% of my colleagues, I stayed much longer than I planned, because of the money. This is a long review but I could have easily written a novel about why you should avoid working here. Everything you do is based on metrics. If you don’t hit those metrics, you will receive emails from your manager and possibly director asking why you aren’t doing your job (sometimes it’ll include a graph of your lack of progress throughout the day), and you’ll then need to write out a “plan of action” that includes how you plan to improve. I was less supervised as a high school student than I was at this job. This job would honestly be bearable if you didn’t have managers and directors constantly breathing down your neck and making you focus so much on metrics. The stress from the metrics makes you put all your energy into hitting numbers (which are often fake) instead of focusing on serving the client/working on actual commercial real estate data/research. You will find yourself spending hours trying to hit your goal of 14 interviews because 90% of brokers would much rather communicate via email and don’t have time to sit on the phone answering questions (shocking that a data company hasn’t figure that out considering it’s 2019). One of the company’s biggest flaws is how it treats people who deserve to move up and get promoted. They’ll tell you during the interview process that there are many different avenues you can go down after being a research associate for a year or two, but that’s just not the case for majority of people. I’ve watched numerous people perform consistently well each month, win awards such as “top producer” or “top interviewer,” and take on extra team responsibilities still get passed up repeatedly for promotions over people who either barely met their metrics or are known for cheating the system. One of the popular reasons people are told they didn’t get promoted was because they were “too valuable to lose as a research associate.” In reality, they want certain people to be managers- those who will never question how things are done and those who don’t have a problem micromanaging. You’ll notice there’s a large number of good Glassdoor reviews that people wrote around the same time (written a few months ago)…That’s because the CEO held multiple meetings with different departments to highly encourage people to go onto Glassdoor and leave reviews about how great it is to work at CoStar. Usually, if it’s a decent place to work, you don’t have to ask people at your company to write inflated reviews. In short, the money is great; but if you’re looking for a job that makes you feel valued, requires you to use your brain and critical thinking skills, or gives you any sense of independence, do not take this job.","2.0

No one will stand up to anyone a superior has to say. All employees are treated as if they are easily replaceable at any time. VP's do not care about you. Only interested in assisting in your career development if it makes them look better. VP will come on the floor and scream and yell. Loves to overreact to everything. Doesn't seem to understand the conference room/office door is glass and not soundproof. Can be heard openly discussing wanting to fire employees and talking trash about his management team. Management/VP will talk negatively about employees behind their back. Management spends more time focusing on cell phones and people taking 5 minutes to chat with a colleague than actual performance. VP loves to remind everyone that he has your career in his hands. Will destroy any chance you have an advancement if you upset him even once. One director is great, the other treats her staff like garbage. DC office is shutting down, leadership knew for months yet still would not let anyone move into other roles within the company. The ultimate example of the selfishness of the VP. Only cares about himself and not any of his staff.","1.0

Also, most of the employees are truly kind and very friendly, and I will sure miss them.","Dear prospective employee, Read this carefully even if you are desperate for work because you will not have time to look for another job while working at Costar. This is the worst place to work and the executive management is even worse. The rest of the management is a bunch of “yes” men and women. They will lie during the interview process and tell you that it’s an outside sales job but it’s not much more than a telemarketing job. They will lie and tell you that you’ll earn lots of commissions but you will not. They will tell you stories about cash bonuses and car giveaways then you find out that they were only company cars as they nickel-n-dime you on your business expenses. You will be just a number. You will feel like a slave. Expect to pay for parking out of your own earnings. Expect to work 60+ hours a week every week with no end in sight until you quit. Expect to be micromanaged beyond your wildest imagination. Expect to feel sick physically and mentally due to the enormous stress. Expect to waste your PTO to go to the doctor or the dentist while working long hours during your personal time at home. Expect endless changes. Expect to perform to unattainable and ridiculous metrics every week, or you will be humiliated in front of your peers. When you are in production (out of training) and receive your book of business, expect to receive many reversals (full value chargebacks) on cancelled subscriptions that you had nothing to do with, but if the customer renews, you will NOT receive credit for the entire renewal amount, you will only receive whatever net new increase you added, which will be wiped away by other chargebacks/cancellations. I could write many pages about this horrible work environment but I hope you get the picture. Run and don’t look back even if you are desperate for work. You will find a much better employer and do not believe the good reviews on Glassdoor because they are FAKE as Costar’s reputation.","1.0

Because it is easier and cheaper than fixing the problems and because most of the people they want to hire will not look past the star rating at the top of the page. Ignore job titles when searching reviews. Thousands of Researchers just had their name changed to Marketing ultant. Photographers had their job changed to Field Researcher. Poof!

Wed May 29 2019 21:48:44 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Research Associate,"Richmond, VA",Former Employee ,"Great benefits/pay, terrible culture. Please read full review.",I worked at CoStar Group full-time for less than a year,CoStar offers some of the most competitive compensation and benefits packages in the job market. That's about it.,"The research department at CoStar is bogged down by terrible and toxic upper management. The quality of the data obtained by researchers is compromised due to the expected standard of metrics, which are constantly imposed by intimidation and threats. I constantly went into work on any given day expecting to be fired for not performing to their extremely high metrics. Lower level management is pressured from levels above them, which in turn places pressure on actual researchers themselves. I could tell that managers at a direct level above researchers were under immense pressure from highers up to have their teams perform well, to the extent where they confidentially acknowledged shortcomings with policies and procedures that were counter-intuitive to day to day operations with their teams. I could not name more than five people in such a large office that actually enjoyed coming to work for such a toxic and awful company. If you can tolerate a god awful work environment with the guise of cash incentives and a month long Tesla rental in front of you, then by all means go for it. CoStar is an extremely large and successful company that occupies such a major portion of the industry it operates in, which gives it a major advantage in initial appeal for potential new hires in the job market. What you don't initially see are the levels of turnover and the morale of the people that come into work consistently miserable due to being berated for not obtaining pointless metrics that reflect nothing about their work ethic or the quality of data submitted in the long run. The saddest part is, the people who make major decisions at CoStar could probably care less, especially for lower level employee retention for the Richmond research headquarters. They can pull from a new batch of recent college grads every three months from the several colleges in the area, and keep bodies in the building until they get fed up and quit after they can't take it anymore. Personally, I have never had a job take such an adverse toll on my mental health until I joined CoStar. I feel like a whole new person after getting the hell out of there. In context to other reviews on here, I agree with the fact that there may be fake reviews listed to boost and inflate the overall rating of the company based on feedback. Many of the direct company responses acknowledge the metric driven atmosphere, but please know how that is constantly shoved in your face and essentially determines your value to the company. The entire research department is composed of people that don't care, either because the job is pointless and requires you to harass brokers/random businesses to ""solicit information"" (obtain a 90 second phone call to obtain credit for looking like you're attempting to do your job), or people that just show up, do the job, and leave without any sense of fulfillment or enjoyment about what they actually do. Truly think long and hard about what you want to sacrifice for the enticing compensation and benefits package. I took a significant pay cut after breaking ties with the company and I feel so much better about doing so when looking at the bigger picture. If you don't want to hate your job and yourself, don't give CoStar any of your time or consideration.","1.0

The company is growing, rapidly - and the concrete numbers are there to support the statement. CoStar is the Google of commercial real estate and is certainly aiming to be an in-home name. Everything I could want from a technical perspective as an Engineer is here with opportunities to work in machine learning, customer-facing applications, internal applications, data analytics.

In doing that you miss out on talented individuals. •Promotions/Lateral Moves - Upper management has blocked everyone on the DC research team from moving through the company. Regardless of how long you have been here your request to apply to another position will be denied. That is very frustrating because when you are hired you are advised that after 6 months of service you are eligible to apply & interview for other internal positions. If they can block one department that tells you that no one is safe. •Parking/Commuter Benefits - CoStar subsidizes your commute cost by 100 if you use public transportation. The average employee who uses public transportation spends 290-320 monthly. Parking is 240 monthly with no contribution from CoStar. If you drive you are spending about 3500 annually (includes cost of gas/parking) & 3700 if you utilize public transportation (includes train/bus fare & parking at metro station) Why not increase how much you subsidize for public transportation & provide a something for employees towards their monthly parking fees. •Sick time - 5 days annually ( the average annual sick days taken is 9.8. The fact that employees have to use their personal/vacation/leave without pay time if they fall ill is ridiculous; not very employee centered) What if you come down with a really bad cold or your child is ill, you can easily blow through those days. •Fake flexible work schedule - (not really flexible people are always watching your coming & goings) Regardless of how well you do your job you will always be micromanaged. No autonomy. •No WFH - (it’s 2019 I don’t understand how the company is so against WFH - I do think it’s interesting that management practices WFH often) •Medical/Dental/Vision - Give employees more options other than Aetna •Annual Bonus - Stop telling new hires they can earn up to a 10% annual bonus when in all actuality no one gets more than 8% •Profit sharing - Does not exist •Dress code - Andy Florance hates jeans so regardless of how nice you are dressed jeans are a no go. A lot of people commute in by train/bus and a majority of the positions in the DC office are not direct customer facing so I’m not understanding why jeans are banned.","1.0

To put it into perspective think of Wall-Mart we can all agree that its competition is Target. Now CoStar is equivalent to Wall-Mart but its competition is the equivalence of a dollar tree. So that allows for a monopoly of the real estate information. And those thinking they can change that will eventually get bought out by CoStar, that's why its called CoStar Group.

CoStar is a very racist company. The department I worked in (apartments.com) was 97% African American which included managers and the director. The job itself was very repetitive and almost robotic-like. Breaks were minimal considering you're expected to make 250+ calls a day. Coming into the job everyone seems friendly until you've worked there long enough. A lot of nepotsim goes on in this place. If you are favored here, they will cover up a lot of tardiness and adjust your metrics. There is no work life balance especially if you have children. HR completely ignores any concerns you may have. If you are considering a job here and you absolutely need a paycheck then this job may work for you, but career wise look elsewhere.","1.0

Any administrative tasks are to be completed before 8am or after 5:30pm. Think you can make it work in between? Think again, the client facing metrics you are held accountable to hit guarantee you will be working by 6am and past 9pm all day everyday. The culture is a shark tank and every sales market has the same quota and same price for the product— so forget presidents club if you’re not in a major city. Every stop you take, every dial you make is audited. If you’re looking to make great money then costars the place. If you’re looking for great company culture and work life balance, this really isn’t a great option. Do some research on the company and be prepared to give up any life outside of work if you choose to sell for CoStar.

As a company focused on data and analytics, it make sense that they will metric the performance the employees and the company - but once you meet some of those quality/performance minimums you are really given the freedom to make your career your own. This is easily the most powerful and influential CRE company in the industry - I truly feel fortunate every day to be a part of that. One of the most important aspects of employee satisfaction and talent retention is recognition of those people who are really integral to your success as a company. CoStar does this better than anyone. Recently we had our Annual Sales Conference in Phoenix... After devoting nearly a decade of my life to this company, I was completely blown away by being recognized for all of my efforts over the years. I started as a Field Research Photographer (an important role, for sure) and have been able to challenge myself and grow into a role that I know has impact- and it's so cool to know that our Senior Management and our Executives see that and appreciate it... So much so that I won a spot in our President's Club and will be traveling on an all-expenses paid trip to St. Kitts & Nevis in a few months. In addition to that, I was named to the CoStar Hall of Fame (a true shock and an honor!) - this recognition came with a company car... a brand new, bright red Tesla! You hardly ever think of a corporation as being generous, but they certainly are (in countless other ways above and beyond just this.)","At Sales Conference, Andy (our CEO) initiated Town Hall meetings where we could all share ideas for improvement within the company and truly be transparent about struggles we are facing. With a company this large, for efficiency, bureaucracy is inevitable... but he heard every issue and suggestion with an open mind and a commitment to make lasting change where needed. (In the weeks since, he has made immediate and positive change already - proving that they are a company of action.) I think every company is going to face challenges, but if you seek out opportunities to get feedback from your employees, to show them you value them, then there isn't any ""Con"" that can't be overcome. I am continually convinced that the company Andy built over 30 years ago is destined to be successful for this reason: CoStar values, supports and recognizes it's employees. It's been my honor to create my career here.","5.0

I've worked at my fair share of organizations throughout the years and I can honestly say that this was the first place where I was pleasantly surprised by the recruiting and hiring process. They were appropriately responsive and forthcoming when I requested information, the interview process was not long and drawn out, and the onboarding process has been above-average. Other highlights of the organization include: - Excellent benefits (not just health, but things like commuter benefits and fitness classes) - Competitive salaries - Generous amounts of food offered to employees at no cost - A robust community service and corporate social responsibility culture - Very nice LEED certified HQ building in Washington, D.C., located close to many Metro stops and bus lines - Warm and friendly atmosphere","I can't say that I've experienced many cons thus far, but there are a few things on my radar: - No corporate-wide options for telework. In this day and age, I think this is something all companies are going to need to embrace in order to be competitive in attracting and retaining top talent, especially with the Millennial and Gen Z workforce. Building flexibility and work-life balance into your culture is critically important. - A lot of silos in the organization from what I can tell. I'm hoping to see departments open to sharing information in an authentic and transparent way across all functional groups. This will only help improve employee engagement and organizational effectiveness down the road.","5.0

Sat Dec 01 2018 22:08:28 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Richmond, VA",Current Employee ,Research Review,I have been working at CoStar Group full-time for more than a year,"I wanted to take a moment to paint a real picture of what it's like to work at CoStar. As been overly stated (even in the negative reviews) the pay is competitive, I have several friends in the office who were able to purchases their first home after commencing their work here. The benefits are top tier, which has also been stated repeatedly, and the building, in my opinion is the best in term of aesthetics and views in regards to downtown Richmond. Work life balance is phenomenal, you work 40 hour weeks every week. I want the primary focus of this review to be centered more so around the company, I’ll get to the work aspect in a bit. CoStar wholeheartedly attempts to improve its culture and work environment. I was one of the employees who was hired just a couple of months after it had moved to Richmond. Essentially ever since then, there has been some form of renovations to enhance the ambience, and feel of the work space. Most notably the complete makeover of half of the top floor into a space where employees can go and refresh. They have also recently hired an executive chef who prepares salads among many other things on a daily basis, and mind you this is on top of the $125 we are given monthly to spend in the cafeteria. It is taxed as a form of compensation, which if you use all of it comes out to around $8 bucks a month. CoStar has also sincerely immersed itself within the Richmond community following its relocation. They partner with countless organizations in the city, where researchers are given the opportunity to volunteer for causes they care about. They also sponsor several major festivals and events that take place in Richmond year round. CoStar also donated $2.5 million dollars to VCU last year for the purpose of creating a real estate analytics program. The employee pool is extremely diverse, and is made up of people of a variety of backgrounds, cultures, political views and race. The contributions CoStar has made to the city of Richmond are indisputable. Now getting to the work component of the research role. Let me begin with the fact every researcher that’s hired goes through a four week training program. The program is comprised of two weeks of commercial real estate knowledge, and gaining familiarity with the database, as well as two weeks of conducting research via calling into a portfolio of brokers with listings. You’re exposed to all expectations including metrics. My main point is, you know exactly what you are signing up to do before you get to the floor. Next I want to address metrics. If you are an individual who sets high expectations for yourself and is interested in building a role into a career with a company that is an industry goliath, then metrics will not be an issue. If you’re looking for a job that will allow you to cruise by unchallenged, then metrics will definitely be an issue. I will add this, every researcher is given ample of opportunity to improve their metrics, if they are lacking. There are processes that every manager follows, including a performance improvement plan, which is initiated after consistent low performance, and allows the researcher 30 days to improve their performance, while receiving feedback and coaching from their manager consistently throughout. Moving on to upward mobility, the research roles are the foundation of a career at CoStar. If you can prove yourself in the research department, you are given the opportunity to apply to countless other roles, all across the country. Just this past May, 20+ research associates were promoted to managers, and are currently going through a six month training program involving weeks with professional leadership consultants, and exposure to all aspects of the company. Overall I’m tremendously happy with the decision I made of staying in Richmond, and working for CoStar.","In terms of cons. I’m someone who migrated to the States a long time ago, and was raised with the belief that you are not entitled to anything. Excellence was always expected, and I continue to expect that of myself. With that mindset I have been able to make the best out of this opportunity, and I firmly believe you are provided with more than enough to truly determine your destination within the company.","5.0

They dodged that in the interview. Other people have said the same thing pertaining to their interviews. They micro manage you and track EVERYTHING over half the people in my dept are unhappy working there. I’d say about 80% *shrugs*. The environment is uncomfortable you feel like you’re being judged by your every move. There are also people who secretly watch people and tell management about the littlest things that have nothing to do with them, their work or your work! I’ve seen people who are new start looking for work elsewhere after like 3 months of being there. I’m open to work at Starbucks until another position opens up. Don’t let the free stuff fool you. Its a heavily metrics environment and all they want are results no matter the cost of the employees level of stress. Some people are handling it well. I will say this though..... I don’t think every manager sucks. I enjoy working with some of the people there. I’ve developed quite a few friendships as well BUT STILL!

Sun Jan 13 2019 19:45:18 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Field Research Photographer,,Current Employee ,Caution,I have been working at CoStar Group full-time for more than a year,At first glance this company has a lot to offer. The company has been around for 30+ years and continues to grow. So there are numerous departments and opportunities to move within the company. In certain positions there is an opportunity for travel and equipment (required to do the job) will typically be provided to every employee.,"The opportunity for growth and movement within the company is typically over advertised at hire. To begin with, every position requires a bachelor’s degree or higher, even the low level positions. The salaries are less then adequate for hourly employees and low-mid level management positions. The upper management and executive team profit nicely, however. The salaries are pre-determined based on job classification and do not take previous work experience or market cost of living into account. Therefore an employee working in Omaha Nebraska receives the same compensation as an employee performing the exact same work in New York City. The company will frequently make process, business, and staffing changes that directly impact large departments without proper communication or explanation. Last year the seasoned management team within the Field Research Department were forced out and replaced with many individuals that had little to no experience in leadership. Some of these new managers lack the experience and skill set to develop and mentor their hourly employees. In general, the company has little trust or empathy for their employees working in the field. This negative culture, mistrust, and poor leadership stems directly from the top individuals in the company. The amount of unprofessional, humiliating, and even aggressive communication sent out by these individuals (to the entire company or department) are astounding for a company this size. This is a company that will use you, abuse you, and discard you when continent to do so. Apply at your own risk.","1.0

It depends on where you work and what department you end. In terms of company-wide benefits, you get some excellent health/dental/vision insurance, great 401K and employee stock purchase programs, and some other minor things. Depending on if you are in Richmond, DC, CA, Atlanta, Canada, UK, etc... you get a decent selection of healthy snacks and coffee/juice/etc. That is about it.","They sell the Research positions as some amazing, profound career choice where you are going to be meeting and greeting the movers and shakers of commercial real estate. That cannot be further from the truth. Do NOT listen to their lies in the interview process. First, I will give you cons of Research and below that just about the Company itself. Research is terrible. Don't do it. Your whole world will be ran by metrics that make no sense. For instance, how many phone calls did you have in one day that lasted 90+ seconds ... yes, you actually have that over your head. Not the quality of data ... you also have to read branding statements on every call. No matter if they are a new client (where I guess it could make sense) or if they have been a client for 8 years. YOU will be working in a call center. Don't believe anything else they tell you. You went to college for 4 years and paid a bunch of money just to work at a call center. Congrats. Oh - and if you do get promoted, even to Senior Research Associate, you will just continue to do the same tasks as you did the years before that promotion. It is such a huge waste of time and effort. Unless you absolutely love the corporate dance of brown-nosing and drinking the koolaid, then you will hate your time here. You can absolutely tell that Baby Boomers are running the company based off a lot of current actions by management. Speaking of management, the managers you will have in Research are terrible - for the most part. If you remember the gossip in high school, then imagine that x7128378. Managers will railroad you depending on if you are a ""performer"" or not. Ugh -- just typing this out makes me wish that either a war will break out so I can get drafted and get away from CoStar or that I get another job -- it's not for the lack of trying. It's just that if you want to be in Commercial Real Estate, CoStar Group is a huge bruise on your resume and be prepared to toe the grey area in your interviews where you don't bash your current employer but also have to bash them because the person that is interviewing you is bashing them. You can read a ton of reviews (and I suggest that you do) and see that the majority of them are all negative. The positive reviews you see, I would say the bulk of them are fake. You can look at the trends on Glassdoor and see the huge uptick ... a year ago Andy Florance had like a 30% approval rate, and now it's above 50%. Instead of fixing the culture and treating their employees with dignity, they decided to just have people write fake positive reviews. That is CoStar Group in a nutshell - instead of just fixing the issue directly, they find workarounds to where they can continue without having to actually change anything or spend money. I have met people in several different departments from in all div isions that work is sales, research, marketing, IT, etc... I have rarely met anyone that enjoys working for CoStar Group. Those that I work with and run into -- they cannot wait until another opportunity comes along to get away. Clients hate CoStar Group. We increased our pricing 200-400% over the past year or two -- with a huge increase when our main ex-competitor, Xceligent. Then they increased quotas for their sales teams across the board. Andy also decided to send out a huge, I don't know what you would call it... um ... marketing materials where the only point of them was to show existing clients that we beat Xceligent... from the brokers and whatnot I have contacted it, they thought (along with most employees of CoStar) found tacky","1.0

Most of the other employees are cool people, and you will bond over your shared misery.","The. Worst. Job. Ever. This is the kind of company that when the CEO realized that poor reviews were hurting their recruiting efforts, instead of fixing the company culture, they fixed the reviews instead. If you look at the ratings trend chart, you can see when the ratings magically increased with the fake reviews that managers wrote and told other people to write. Anyway, the job itself. Outbound call center. This billion dollar company gathers data to sell to its subscribers by calling up people who work for businesses across the country and ask them a series of asinine questions that they mostly don’t know the answer to. If they do know the answer, they refuse to share it and will yell at you for bothering them while they are working. You’d rather have a conversation about STD’s, trust me. And if the job itself isn’t bad enough, you will then be micromanaged to death. Managers spend most of their days looking like zombies staring at stat boards hanging all over the office. They compare us to each other every minute of every day. To stay afloat here, you must cheat and enter fake data. They have no patience for accuracy. When they built this office in Richmond they had a blank slate and could have created a fun, positive, collaborative company culture. But with the managers they hired, they created the exact opposite. They created a culture of punishment, fear and anxiety instead. Your work will never be good enough for them. No one in upper management has an MBA. They appear to throw darts at the dart board on 9th floor to make decisions, but don’t worry, they’ll change their mind next week anyway and do something different. Listen, if I didn’t feel the need to warn people to stay far far away from CoStar, I wouldn’t have bothered to write a review. People routinely leave here for jobs paying $15k less per year. Horrible reputation around Richmond. This is a dead end job. Even the people who get promoted are miserable. Management likes to think only a few people are unhappy, but that’s not true. There’s a plague here. Everyone starts off excited about the opportunity and it takes about 30-60 days for your soul to be sucked out of you. How long you stay beyond that is on you.... But the good news is, your soul returns after you leave.","1.0

It is an overall young company and offers so much room for growth. The pay and benefits are awesome and the overall work load is not piled on you. You can manage your days accordingly and take ownership of what you need to get done without managers breathing down your back. You pretty much leave everything at work when you are done as well which is amazing and creates a really nice work-life balance.","With the amount of callas you are making on a daily basis and the amount of talking I think we should receive a few additional personal days. At times it can feel like you are in high school again , ie.) punching the clock, taking tests when the system is down, etc. Small things, but we are all adults and I'd like to think the majority of us can manage our time on our own... and if not, maybe those individuals need to be somewhere else.","4.0

Competitive, so you have to have drive to thrive. Pays well, benefits are great, monthly company happy hours, provided card for lunch which basically pays for your lunch for the month, beautiful view of the city and James river. The company is growing so quickly that managers often change, so you have to be adaptable and embrace the change. Sale leads bonuses, monthly bonus competitions, annual pay raise and yearly promotions make the pay top notch. 2 weeks vacation that accrue and can rollover, 1 week of sick, 2 personal days, additional days for wedding, maternity, etc. I would take what someone from each position takes with a grain of salt— different positions may have different benefits. It’s an amazing job right out of college or for anyone who has been working for a while. 40 hours a week as a portfolio researcher, paid hourly. Also have opportunities to travel to the market you call in. There are Christmas parties and we had a sales convention in February and had Zac Brown Band play privately for the company. It was great! The job focuses on calling people everyday. However metrics have changed a LOT in the past year. You are no longer just calling to update— we work on a lot of various projects daily so it stays busy and no longer feels like just a call center. The company is great and the job is good but not for everybody.","As with any job there are cons. Micro managing can seem a bit harsh due to the need to meet metrics. Hence, if you are successful at what you do then you won’t be micro managed that bad. So not a big con. It can get a bit redundant after a while. Even with the company constantly growing and changing, since we measure our metrics monthly, it feels like I live by the month and then next month it just starts over. There are frequent glitches with the systems we work on and that makes everything less efficient and more stressful. Minor con and happens everywhere.","5.0

Before accepting the position I asked a friend how she liked the job. She really seemed to like it. She said you work 5hours in the car, then 3 hours at home editing everyday. Sounded fine and I took the job. I went to training in Richmond VA and Washington DC for about a week was trained exactly as explained, around 5 hours driving in search of for sale/ rent commercial properties and 3 hours of editing and uploading at home. The owner Andrew Florance comes and talks with the trainees for a full day. His presence and speech is captivating, making you think you’re in for the best job of your life. That’s what it was for the first year, an awesome job. Things have changed drastically. In the past 3 months I’ve gone through 3 different managers and literally no one I started with, including 2 of my previous managers, 80% of my original team nor friends still work for costar. Now you’re expected to work the entire 8hr day from your car. Also being micromanaged and tracked every step of the day. It would take me far to long to list all the cons of this job.

Fri Dec 07 2018 17:36:36 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Field Research Photographer II,"Cleveland, OH",Former Employee ,Field Research is a Nightmare Department and talking to HR will get you Fired.,I worked at CoStar Group full-time for more than 3 years,"Benefits, toys, some co workers.","Field Researchers are expected to act like robots, are tracked, double tracked and triple tracked. Cars are wired with cameras and gps trackers to keep employees in-line. Tracking is important in the job of a Field Reaearcher, however, management uses it more as a contol mechanism and for their own agendas. Your car is your office. You get in, you drive, you take pictures, you grab data, you edit, you stay there. Some have learned to take bathroom breaks in their cars for fear of letting the car sit for too long and/or not able to achieve unrealistic metrics. A good chiropractor will come in handy as well. If the car does not move after 15 minutes, you will get a phone call and a warning. If your manager sends you to a territory, and arbitrarily decides you are not where he/she wants you to be, they will threaten to write-you up. There is no flexibility. It’s a surprise that this company has not micro-chipped their employees yet. Metrics are challenging because they are always changing. If the company needs to save money, and increase stock prices to please shareholders, metrics are changed randomly and without notice to make them unattainable so bonuses are reduced or not paid. It is an up and down cycle. Once you figure it out and start making your goals, they change the mark. Three months ago the Field Research management team was “changed” specifically because the managers were too nice and “not doing their jobs”. The new managers have been trained to be hunters, and were given a document in training that shows them what to look for and how to find fault with their team members and keep them in line. Managers will pretend to be your friend, and turn on you in a heartbeat because of their own agendas. It’s a very selfish organization. There are no team players. If you have concerns, are a model employee, and express your concerns to HR, be warned, you will be fired. There is no open-door policy in any way shape or form. If you hear otherwise, it would not be the truth. This holds true on all levels, management or minion.","1.0

(1 star)","This is specific to the multi family side, apartments.com, but the info sales side is pretty bad too. There are so many cons. But here are some of the highlights: If you don’t have existing relationships to squeeze money out of property management executives you CANNOT make money here. If you’re lucky they will throw you 25% of a deal if it’s sold into your territory. Your territory will change without your consent, in my case three times in 8 months. Completely changed and the first change happened before I even started and was 35-90 miles from my home. Your performance is based on checking off boxes for visiting with properties for meetings with no real purpose for the most part. They also have telemarketers call behind on 10% of your meetings to “ensure” you were there and dressed professionally. Many of my clients found it intrusive and offensive towards me because of the nature of the questions. Sales, millions of dollars in sales are tracked on a SPREADSHEET, a freaking SPREADSHEET! That you can request changes from your manager (who is bonused on their teams sales for) so dozens of people can make changes to the numbers. Ridiculous. The CRM or CRMS (there are several) are ancient. They only use sales force for bill credits and your manager won’t even know how to use them so don’t bother asking. Lastly, you’re selling ONE product, advertising on apartments.com there is no upsell except for a level up on an ad package. This is not the job for a professional outside sales person.","2.0

You genuinely feel happy for people when they announce they've found another job, which happens just about every day since everyone is constantly job hunting, instead of making pointless calls.","None of the work you do is relevant or meaningful, since it's discarded all the time. Calls are judged based on whether they meet the 90 second mark or not, before all else, so good calls where you get deals and comps, or new listings don't count if they are less than 90 seconds. Prepare to watch all your hard work be disregarded because of time difference of even a single second. Emails do not even count at all even though that is where you get some of the most useful information. Market portfolio assignments change like the wind, and if you get a good manager, prepare to kiss them goodbye because it's almost as if having an endless parade of managers is mandatory. Management always changing their mind, and all they care about is how busy you look on paper not what is actually happening. Get ready to be insulted and abused by clients on the phone who threaten to report you for stalking and harassment, but you will have no choice but to call them again the next day.

Tue Oct 23 2018 19:04:50 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Tenant Research Associate I,"Richmond, VA",Former Employee ,My Story Working With Costar,I worked at CoStar Group full-time for less than a year,Not really a good experience,"I have been thinking about writing this review for a while. Now I decided to write it because it has been in my heart to do so and I want to be heard. A couple of months ago, I decided to leave my job of 2 years for Costar as a Tenant Research Associate I. I was very successful at my last job but looking to have more opportunities to grow. I was very excited to start a great career in a Fortune 500 company! The plus side was the beautiful scenery of downtown Richmond. I began training for my position. For new hires, the first 2 weeks are in a classroom where you learn the introduction of Commercial Real Estate and the last 2 weeks are in nesting. The first two weeks were great and I learned a lot. We even presented a Presentation for management in our department and I met wonderful people there. The last two weeks, it slowly went down hill. A couple of days into nesting, my trainer decided to audit my call I did on the first day. It was one of my first calls. In which I was shocked because I was just learning the system and interacting with the customers on the phone for the very first time in my Commercial Real Estate career. But she said the first audits for new hires usually are very low, so don’t worry about it. So, I did not, I pressed forward in nesting. My next audit was one of the best from the class. Just to let you know, that while in nesting, the amount of calls and interviews that you have done throughout the day is on a television screen in nesting. You can see how you are doing and compare yourself to your peers. This is very important to remember this for later. It is the most important information in this story. During the second week of nesting, the trainer had one-on-ones with everyone in nesting to review your performance thus far. This was a Wednesday or a Thursday, so we had a couple of days left in nesting before we go onto production. While I was in nesting, I was improving on my daily goals. As a Tenant Research Associate, you have to researched six tenants an hour with three interviews, which are calls that are at least 90 seconds. Throughout nesting, in comparison to my peers, my performance was right in the middle. I was not the very top person out of nesting nor the very bottom. During my one-on-one with my trainer, she told me that I had to make sure that I increased the amount of tenants researched and I told her that I will for that day and the days after because I was already improving and had began researching my daily goal already. Please remember this part as well, because this the the second important part of this story that will come up later. She told that to majority of the class. I know this because the class ate lunch together and used to talk about our day. And I did want I promised I made my goals for the rest of the week. On the last day of nesting, it was almost lunch time so I was there for almost four hours, my trainer pulled me to the side and taken me downstairs. She guided me to this room and it turns out to be her manager. I found out that day, I was terminated due to my performance. I was shocked because I had improved so much during my 2 weeks of nesting and that I actually reached my goals. But, he told me that I was not consistent enough for that. He also told me that my audits were not high enough. I asked him what he meant by audits. He began to give me scores of my audits that I NEVER heard of before and I told him that my trainer never mentioned any additional audits and had not reviewed it with me during my one-on-ones. I asked him what did I missed on my Audits? I was totally confused! He said that he did not have this information. I told him that this is my first time hearing about this. During this meeting, there was a woman on the phone, that was part of the meeting and told me that there will be an exit interview sent to my email address for me to send back on what I think should be improved on the company. Guess what? I never received an exit interview even after I requested it through an email. This is not even the worse part. Later on the very day, one of my friends that I met at Costar texted me to see where I was. I told her what happened and she said that she was sorry for me and I asked her if she likes her team and she said that she did. I asked her this question to see if she still works there and she is. Which is very interesting to me. Remember earlier in the story when I told you that everyone productions are on the television screen so everyone in nesting can see it. Over two weeks of nesting, my production was always better than hers and after the one-on-ones, she did not even reached the daily goals and she still works there! Mind you me and her are different races. Things that makes you really think! I could not believe my treatment from this company. I gave up a decent job to come here to just be unfairly let go. Now I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life. Some days are better than others but each day I strive to be what I want in life. I feel so relieved that I am finally telling my story. It is a huge burden off my chest. Someone close to me asked me, by putting this review on here how will it benefit me, I told them that I just want to be heard and understood.","1.0

They asked people to write 4/5 star reviews to boost the rating and help with recruiting. This company is the definition of a toxic work environment in 2018. CoStar will tell you that this is a place to develop your commercial real estate skills, when reality it is a metric driven call center where you have to question your integrity just to keep your head above water. All you do is call people 1,000 times until they yell at you about how CoStar cheats their customers. I cannot explain how many times you have to call someone that has asked multiple times for CoStar to remove their number. Would you like to move up at costar? Be a sheep. Managers, and all leadership at CoStar do not like when people who question their methods. So managers end up being 24 year olds with no management background that they can mold into their own. Making every manager at this company a micromanager with no idea what it’s like to motivate employees or be passionate about what they do. It is shocking that a company in 2018, that wants to hire millennials, doesn’t care if their employees are happy and want to be there. Employees are unhappy because goals that are being set are unreachable. If you are meeting metric expectations at this company you are not enough. If you are exceeding metric expectations at this company you are not enough. To CoStar It is more important to point out the faults in an employee than bring up the positives. Have you ever had someone pace up and down the aisles of a job to make sure you are working? Even the CEO does this! Why in the world do you want your employees to fear you?

If you are lucky enough to be a manager's favorite then they will look out for you once new opportunities arise. If not, then you are out of luck. Brokers hate hearing branding statements when you speak to them every month, sometimes multiple times a month but you will be dinged in an auditor score if you don't hit them with a generic branding statement.","3.0

When I started a year and a half ago, I thought the Tenant Research position would be a transitional job, one to hold me over until I found something more in my field. In that time, I've grown to enjoy my job most of the time. If you rely on your managers, they will help you develop your skills and understand the importance of the work and research being conducted. Being a call center environment, one needs to understand the importance of the metrics and being held accountable for the work being done. Clients count on us for complete and accurate information. For that, we are paid well and given benefits that exceed most expectations. We are also given a monthly lunch allotment, free snacks, incentives, and access to a company chef.","Expectations and assignments can change quickly.

CoStar was a great place to work for and having been through many M&As (i.e. LoopNet/Apartments.com) it all seemed to head in the right direction. I even considered this being my last employer until everything changed at our annual sales conference. Many reviews here from sales representatives all point to the disaster that occurred when the company decided to double sales quotas, decrease commission payouts and then institute a whole host of initiatives with the sole purpose of boosting the stock price. On our Monday calls, they have no problem admitting that every decision is to increase our stock price even at the expense of long-term employees. It's sad to say many great and talented employees are leaving at alarming rates with management not even doing anything to fix the situation. Literally every single sales rep I know of has never seen morale this low and none have felt so worthless as they do now. It is an unhappier CoStar.","1.0

Costar is very strict about talking to your desk neighbor while working to pass time. It is very micromanaged and I have witnessed some managers treating and talking to employees like scum. The job is easy but it’s repetitive and boring. The moral is so low that ppl don’t care about the quality of the job only the quantity to meet their numbers to stay employed.

The Human Resources Dept for this company is a joke. They are not knowledgeable on the policies and are extremely bias. As a research Associate,you are given pretty useless busy work to complete as your job description. Basically it is just a soliciting call center. Your job is to annoy brokers every day for a conversation that needs to meet a certain duration of time for it to be considered “valuable”. You must reach out to the same brokers every month about the same property to ask the same questions. Not a lot of racial diversity at the top of the company.","1.0

Wed Sep 19 2018 16:46:41 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Research Associate II,"Columbia, MD",Former Employee ,CoStar Group: Where everything is made up and the points don't matter!,I worked at CoStar Group full-time for more than 3 years,"People, Pay and Benefits and POTLUCKS If you need the money take the job but only keep it for as long as you can stand it! The office I worked at people were the nicest and most hard working people. We used to make a lot of jokes about how misery loves company. I genuinely think people are overly friendly in the office I worked in because we all know this job is ridiculous. I always felt like everyone genuinely cared about me but outside of that office which is now closed there are few good people left.","Everything else about this company! If I could give this company a 0 I WOULD! This is not a research job this is a glorified call center. They do not listen to their clients and they definitely do not care about their employees! They also force employees new and old to post fake reviews so their company will have a high rating! When the office was going to close there was a spike in positive reviews over the course of 4-6 days. In addition to posting fake positive reviews they actually have to go out of their way to deter people from writing other negative reviews by threatening legal action against them because this company SUCKS! The metrics change whenever upper level management feels like changing them and then by the way no matter what point of the month you are in it affects your whole month. If you do not meet the metrics you better have a good excuse as to why otherwise you get put on a list. The brokers/clients hate the monthly phone calls from us but CoStar won't hear or understand them and makes us continue calling. There has been more than one occasion of ""Yes sir, I know we spoke last month, yes sir I know the info has not changed but I need to read the info, yes I know, yes I know."" then usually a give up by the researcher to just take the hit on their metrics or a hang up by a client. To avoid this most people leave long voicemails, dial through the directory, or dial the office to be transferred to the cell to increase their interviews every day! When researchers should be actually looking for commercial real estate information to IMPROVE THE DATA the really can't because people are too caught up in reaching their metrics to do any other kind of research. Also CoStar is the place where they reward you for cheating and for being lazy. When we are assigned a team project if you do really well and do your work you get rewarded with the remainder of the work that your lazy coworkers didn't do. You also know they didn't do anything because they stood around chatting or purposefully muttered to themselves that they weren't going to do it because they didn't agree with it. Even though we were all assigned the same amount and we'll all be spoken to when it is not completed they don't care, no one seemed to care even when the office was thriving. This was a re-occurring theme with projects within the team or even within the office, you didn't have to do your work because if you didn't you would get a ""talking to"" and then the rest of the office would do your work for you. Some of us care too much about our work and credibility to make someone do our work for us. I understand being a team player but this is ridiculous. The managers know it's the same people too because they consistently boycott the work but their call numbers are good so it doesn't matter or the manager doesn't care enough. Speaking of managers I have worked under some of the most lazy, irresponsible, ignorant managers I have ever worked for. Senior and Certified researchers with 5-9 years of experience could run circles around most of the managers there but because they don't have a degree they couldn't be promoted. I could count on one hand the amount of research managers that were actually good at their job. The company plays favorites! They didn't even offer our upper level manageable jobs to continue with the company because they didn't get along with management above them even though they had been with the company a long time. Again I reiterate they don't care about their employees. I have offered several suggestions on how to re-format our job to help the environment not be so toxic, but my suggestions were never passed above my manager because it wasn't worth it to them to pass it along. It has never been in CoStar's best interest to listen to their employees at all, you would think the person who does this job every day might be able to offer some insight to the tools I need to succeed but that is not their view. They even created a spreadsheet that showed us who was remaining on our list that we could call in order to fulfill our requirements which seemed like a step FINALLY in the right direction. But one month it was given to us, the next it was taken away because we were ""cherry picking"" our clients. We were only given enough clients to have approximately 5-8 calls a day, but we were expected to get closer to 15. How do you pull clients out of thin air? When they came to announce our office was closing the person actually made jokes while they announced it. If that doesn't deter you from working for this awful company I don't know what will. Finally the company's turnover rate is very high, most people only stay for 6 months to a year because it's not worth it! Crying in my office was common due to the high level of stress by certain individuals, one person even threatened violence on the company on several occasions.","1.0

It’s repetitive work where you have to hit your call and dial goals or management will be on your case, daily. Direct supervisors vary on their methods but most are NOT handsoff since upper management is also on their case if their “team” doesn’t achieve the monthly goals. As a result, upper management becomes a boogeyman. It’s hard to find the motivation to work at a job which is the exact same thing until maybe you’re able to move up (around month 5ish). The “clients” are also very wary of costar in the CRE industry. The little fish hate costar (takes their info for free to sell a product they have no use for) and the big fish only have their admins talk to us so you get very squeezed with whom you can speak. You’re essentially in a quasi salesman/customer service position even though your department says “research.”","2.0

Basically, we are collecting information about businesses across America to add to our database. I talk to business owners, brokers, property managers, and building owners throughout the day. It's a phone based job so expect to be on the phone a good portion of each day. The benefits are way above average and they even help with tuition reimbursement!

I've been here just over a year and have received a promotion to management and a $10,000 raise, there are lots of similar stories - Huge future growth potential into new market areas for the company and the current employees. If you are hired as a researcher but have a special aptitude for sales or programming or client relationship management etc, you can move laterally within 6 months of hire. The company values putting the right people in the right roles. - Lots of perks and performance based bonus opportunities","- Very metrics driven for the entry level positions. They pay better than virtually any other entry level role in Richmond, so you are expected to spend your time in the office actually producing. - Changing directives/expectations, which is the nature of a growing company but it can be frustrating - Lack of interdepartmental collaboration. Many people are unaware of what many others in the office do day to day which can stymie innovation. - Performance incentives can often incentivize gaming/cheating, which can be rampant and self-reinforcing.","5.0

Our company offers excellent medical/dental/vision benefits, matches up to 4% of your 401k contribution which fully vests at 4 years, lengthy maternity & paternity leave, ample sick and vacation time, discounted stock purchase plan, etc. In addition to these better than industry standard benefits, our company caters to the millennial generation with fun workplace features such as: free gym, free snacks, monthly happy hours featuring local beer, company chef, $150/month credit for lunch, free tickets to Friday Cheers/Folk Festival/River Rock, sports leagues, 3+ philanthropy opportunities each month, tuition reimbursement, etc. Parking does cost $135/month, but where are you going to work downtown that doesn’t charge you for parking? GROWTH & RECOGNITION! We’ve easily promoted 20 Research Associates to Managers in the last 6 months. Out of those promotions, the majority of the employees had only been with the company 1.5 years! We’re not a “good ole’ boy company,” as long as you’re performing in your current position you will be recognized and given the chance to move up. We give out $1,000 and keys to a Tesla each month, and it’s a peer committee that helps choose who is a top performer!","If you don’t like change, taking direction, or you let little things get to you – this job isn’t for you – but probably no other job is either! This job is not a call center – there is no inbound call que, you’re not monitored by the amount of time it takes you to get on the phones – people who keep using this reference have never worked in an actual call center. Now you will use phones, A LOT – we use them to build relationships with brokers, developers, and industry professionals across the USA – but you’re in control over when you call and who you call. This isn’t a job where you can coast. You have to manage your time, put forth an effort, comply to set practices. We don’t pay $50-60,000 for no reason. We use metrics and track data, it’s the way many companies are moving towards. So expect to be held accountable for your work.

I was recently promoted after applying for an internal promotion. Working in Tenant Research you'll be working with people from all different backgrounds. Some people have working in a call center in the past and compare CoStar to that. I disagree because you must put your best foot forward to succeed as an employee. The career is what you make it! I've literally only been asked to do my best and move with the companies goals and I got a promotion. I am not required to take work home to overachieve- just maximize work hours. I was a recent grad still trying to find my way- between understanding corporate structure more and having great benefits etc - I've been able to live a more sustainable life. CoStar is not a call center because call centers pay you a lot less and you don't regularly grow or build relationships. You want to grow as a person, work with great people and be in a challenging environment? Then this is the job for you. If not, don't blame the company because it's been successful, reevaluate your work ethic. The people I've spoken to that have been with the company 5 years and longer don't dwell on the areas of improvement- they continue to use every change as a chance to grow.","Since everyone is given extensive training for the role it's similar to college coursework, to learn then apply. Sometimes people don't optimize that time to learn and you see it when you're working a long side them. I wouldn't blame the company- I just think there are people who interview well and really don't care. Keep in mind though- bad companies don't change. CoStar is ever changing to meet the needs of clients and employees to be as accurate and effective as possible. I've communicated with Directors etc and my feedback is always appreciate. A con is so many employees suffer in silence without seeking help to be better.","4.0

If you cheated your way though high school and drank you way through whatever state college you barely attended, you would be a perfect employee or manager. The upper management looks at a glitchy board to attempt to accurately evaluate researchers performance when all they are doing is increasing the likelihood that employees will cheat to keep up with silly metrics. The Richmond office is filled with mostly 20 year olds and it feels like high school all over again. However, CoStar is easier than any AP class I ever attended. I am not sure if anyone else in the company even knows what AP classes are. Also, the headsets pulled hair out of your head because you wore them so much.

In the time I have been with CoStar I have had the opportunity to take on challenging and rewarding projects at an accelerated pace, I have been awarded company honors and had the chance to travel to the market that I represent. The technological resources far exceed any support I have had in previous employers and the personnel are across the board extremely knowledgeable and resourceful. The salary is more than competitive and the culture and location are very conscientious in creating an enjoyable working experience. I have recommend several friends to apply here and it is because I truly believe this company provides great opportunities to people who are willing to put in the effort to seize them.","There is no perfect job but that being said you can appreciate the relative benefits of one over another, that being said, if you do not have time management strengths or ""suffer in silence"" when you should utilize resources at your disposal you will fall behind your peers and feel stressed. You need to be able to handle multiple projects and understand that some goals are just that and not be defeated in falling short of a goal once in a while, as long as you can speak to your efforts and work with your team you will not fall short of reachable goals. Managers have very different styles so one experience may differ from on to another and projects constantly change. If you do not like changing and adapting this will be a stressful experience.","5.0

Having the VP of Research and CEO around can be intimidating, until you remember these are people that made their lives off of relationships, and being personable. They wanna see you succeed too.

All sales reps walked away from the sales conference feeling demotivated and dejected. You ask any rep how they felt about the new commission plan and you will get negative feedback. Eventually I got over it but then came the most illegal and unethical move I have seen from a company, namely, the non-commissionable deals.

Sat Aug 04 2018 10:48:16 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Inside Sales Representative,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,I never thought I would write a review like this,I have been working at CoStar Group full-time for more than a year,You’ll notice almost all the REAL reviews will say the same few pros 1. Free snacks 2. Good benefits 3. Used to be the pay...not anymore,"This company used to be on some Forbes top some companies to work for...if I had a title for it now, it would be Top Deceiving Companies to work for....on the outside, Costar looks promising, shiny and too good to be true. Well it used to be, until the CEO started caring about and ONLY about the stock price and the investors who pour their money into it. SEARCH “Costar earnings call” and find the transcripts and it will show you what they’re actually focused on. Find the word commissions and you’ll see that they’re focus is on bringing the profit up from a huge loss due to discontinuing a product that THEY decided to cancel...and then they put those cancellations on their own sales reps to make up the negative. So pretty much, instead of incentivizing their employees to work harder to make up the loss by selling more, they decided to punish and scare the employees by cutting commissions. I guess they thought that this would cause the reps to work harder to make more money but all it did was cause some to quit immediately, others to stay for a while until they found a better opportunity and then the rest stayed to see if it would get better but it keeps getting worse... even some of the top executives who have been there for 5,10,20+ years have left!!! What does that tell you?? They do “employee engagement surveys” but they’re pointless because NOTHING gets changed. And this last year, it’s declined way more than before. I’m curious to know the results...actually last year they shared the results. I’m almost positive they either won’t share them because they are so bad, or they will only share the good ones (example: immediate management results, because almost everyone is happy with immediate management...not so much the CEO, and the ones below) Employees are scared to go to HR to complain because nothing stays anonymous and even if you go say something, they direct you back to your manager and then you’re back to square one. Do yourself a favor, don’t even take my word for it, or the other reviews (positive or negative) DO THIS - go to LinkedIn and find researchers and territory reps/managers (anyone other than actual management) and message them DIRECTLY either right there on LinkedIn or find them on Facebook/Instagram and ask what their experience has been. Don’t even do it with one person, do it for at least 5 people and I guarantee you they will all tell you to look elsewhere.... Seriously...do it. If you’re considering to work here, do that one thing and you’ll thank me for it. The ONLY reason I would say you should come and work here is 1. You’re fresh out of college, you have no other choice because nobody else will take you and you just NEED something on your resume - then come for like 6 months just to have that on there and then dip out ASAP 2. You have run out of TV shows to watch on Netflix and you need some new entertainment. Then come on down to Costar, where nobody acts professional, everything is done based on favoritism, and the drama and inappropriate employee/management behavior is through the roof.....don’t forget to bring the popcorn because you’re in for a good laugh. This place is a joke and be ready to ask the question “Can they really do this? Is this even legal??”","1.0

Fri Jun 08 2018 07:19:34 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,A professional quagmire of the highest order,I have been working at CoStar Group full-time,"Before eviscerating every facet of the company in my “cons” section, I will at least attempt to put forth some benefits of working here: Working at Costar, especially in research, customer service, or collections, has a relatively low barrier to entry. If you have a college degree, speak functional english, and have a pulse, you can get a job here. It is an ideal environment for recent graduates to gain corporate experience or early commercial real estate experience prior to moving onto better roles. I advise staying no more than 6 months, partially because lingering here dooms yourself to daily frustration, but also because the skill-set acquired here is not all that marketable beyond other entry level jobs. The biggest upside I have found to Costar is the low stress environment and flexibility. I will cover some of the existential stresses later in my review, but if you are seeking a stable income with low demand, this can be ideal. The metrics, ultimately, are not challenging to meet if time is managed properly. You also build a sort of resilience to the tedium of cold calling and narrow mindedness of management that prepares you, for young graduates at least, for the status quo of old-school corporate America. I’ll pause here to remind you this is a pro of working here. Costar, due to the nature of the work and the structure of the work day, also allows you to schedule vacation or take a sick day at anytime you please. No project is ever so demanding that you must work from X to Y day. Unfortunately, this lack of importance also leads to a sense of professional ennui, since you largely function as a cog in what feels like a dysfunctional Rube Goldberg machine. I wish I had more pros to describe but unfortunately the preponderance of downsides must be addressed, and I am too eager for my long awaited catharsis by writing this review.","In David Foster Wallace’s infamous “This Is Water” commencement address, he notes that “there is actually no such thing as atheism...everybody worships.” For Christianity it is Jesus and the trinity, for Scientology it is Tom Cruise, and for Costar, it is calls. Calls-calls-calls-calls! Upper management displays such a fervor for calling, irrespective of its utility, that every problem, no matter what the quagmire, can be resolved by drumming up an army of researchers to dial the bejesus out of it. Perhaps, though, I should provide some context: Costar, among other things, provides a platform for CRE professionals to pay an exorbitant monthly fee to list their lease and sale listings, research new properties, and run market analyses. The crux of a research job at Costar is to call clients and other CRE professionals as often as possible to gather, validate, or verify information already in the database, then, explain to said clients why you are calling them when they pay you to house and accurately display such information. Management claims that clients want researchers involved to manage their listings, but the cacophony of irked clients I speak with proves otherwise. Most clients, in my experience, use the software purely to generate leads. The data is too unreliable to use for due diligence in any deal. Costar practices a zealous worship of internal metrics that ultimately serve no practical purpose toward improving wellbeing or performance for employees, or the quality of its products. At first this philosophy is just a nuisance, but as the days drag on, participating in such a convoluted and ultimately useless practice wears down on your spirit. Internally, the call metrics are used by management to pat themselves on the back for a “job well done” while other glaring problems that could have real impact on stakeholder wellbeing are brushed under the rug. There is constant feedback from clients to improve the accuracy of the data, yet it's impossible when research metrics are framed around the ability to call and update listings, irrespective of the quality of the data being updated. There is call-focused cabal within upper management that dictates the fixation on calling to all the lower management trees. It's a massive system of coerced stupidity that only stands to benefit a few higher-ups in a quarterly earnings call. Costar is an environment where mediocrity is the norm and putting forth any effort to optimize processes is shrugged off with an air of dissuasive nonchalance. Plenty of bright and talented employees quickly become jaded to the rigid business and management structures, and the inorganic work environment becomes suffocating. Any advice or ideas for change and improvement are routinely shot down- to the degree that its a joke among employees. Costar’s best bet for improving employee well being, client satisfaction, and overall data quality, would be to supplant the call-metrics with valuable research projects to enhance data and better respond to client’s frustrations. Costar is by far the most litigious company I’ve worked for or heard of- to the degree that it puts Donald Trump’s legal history to shame. While the Excelligent investigation made headlines, there are scores of other suits and investigations that don’t bubble up to the outer world. Costar contracts are designed to limit the opportunity for clients to unsubscribe and maximize the ability for Costar to pursue legal action. The sales team emboldens this shady effort by deliberately misdirecting and mis-marketing products to sow as much confusion as possible. This confusion also spills into the realm of customer service: one routinely receives calls from clients trying to rectify simple errors with their accounts- missing log-on information, inaccurate subscription packages, removing old users- but research has no sway over these issues, and we have no choice but to toss them into the maw of the sales and customer service teams. While these practices may not directly affect my day-to-day, my association with a company that endorses such behavior feels like a slow-dripping poisonous thorn in my side. I could go on, but I’m sure at this point I am straining the average attention span for a Glassdoor review. I can only hope this review dissuades those looking to working here, or at the very least, sheds some insight into what to expect.","2.0

Thu Jul 12 2018 07:28:00 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Research Associate,,Former Employee ,Don't Ignore Red Flags,I worked at CoStar Group full-time for more than a year,"CoStar overpays its entry level employees a great deal, and doesn't do any hiring negotiation. So the upside is that if you're a fresh college grad, you'll be making as much as the years industry veteran who was hired at the same time as you. The benefits package is good. The time off is flexible to a degree, though the accrual rate is somewhat below industry average. You will get most holidays off. There is no work from home, and when you clock out you're done. You will be comp'd $150 dollars worth of food at the cafeteria a month, though you will pay roughly $170 a month in parking, so that's kind of a wash. Most of your fellow workers are good people, and you will develop the same kind of camaraderie with them that many poets and authors did in Soviet work camps.","CoStar was a mistake. I realized that a few months in, when my hiring class of fifty or so had already lost ten or fifteen people to attrition. Of those, at the time of my departure from CoStar, only 5 or 6 were left. That's 80% or so attrition over 18 months, and that's about the average rate for the research department. People come and go in waves at CoStar, and meeting someone who has worked there for more than a year or two is unusual. There are reasons for this. Strap in, and let me give you a guided tour. Let's start with the obvious. If you've done any research beyond the 'sugar and rainbows' pitch you'll get during the hiring process, you'll have figured out that CoStar is a call center. Back in the 'old days' when I was hired (late '16, early '17) they basically did everything in their power to get around about this. Calling it a 'call center' was a big nono, and the company took pains to avoid cultivating that image. They're slighly more transparent nowadways, but the hiring folks will still try pretty hard to convince you that you won't just be cold calling all day. Ignore them, you will, and that's your job. Cold call people, ask them about the property they put in your database, and stick to the script. There's a lot of work to be done that isn't cold calling to be sure, but your job security rests entirely on cold calling. The number of 90-second phone calls you get during the day, the percentage of people in your contacts list you have completed a 90-second phone call with, and the number of times you branded during a phone call are the only metrics you will be graded on. Your rapport, client base, number of tasks completed, number of emails answered, work on projects, etc will not be factored in to your job security or promotion. Get sent hundreds of sales and lease comparables to enter into CoStar to make the data better? Best find some time to 'work that in' during your day, because you sure as heck aren't doing that instead of making phone calls. If you can't do it over the phone it isn't work and it doesn't count. You'll hear the phrases 'work it into your day' and 'time management' a lot. I'll explain why this is nonsense later. And the branding, oh boy the branding. You are required to pepper your 90-second phone call with three, count 'em, three branding statements. These are to recited during every phone call, no matter who it is you're speaking too. Things like ""Did you know that CoStar has the largest online commercial real estate marketplace in the world?"" and ""our clients are doing over a trillion dollars of deals a year."" This is exactly as dehumanizing and awful as it sounds, and you will be asked to do this to every single one of your clients on every single call. If you don't brand within the first fifteen to twenty seconds, your phone call will be hit with a negative score bonus that will easily drop it to the low 40's of 50's (out of 100). Have long-term clients you're chummy with, who ask you how your day is? Better cut them off and brand, because if you spend too much time telling them about your newborn child or your recent vacation, you can kiss your score goodbye. This policy is hated and reviled by all employees of every type, and is considered by management to be one of the most IMPORTANT things you can do. I was personally denied a title promotion because I didn't brand enough to my long-term clients, who expressed distaste that I was telling them these things while their company paid roughly 350k a year for all their CoStar services. I brought this up and was told to shut up and brand or my employment would be in jeopardy. But I digress. Let's talk about calls. You have a portfolio of 'clients,' many of whom are just mom and pop shops trying to rent out their old office/retail building, and a handful of actual commercial real estate brokerages with brokers. CoStar gets people to put their properties in its database by offering them a 'free listing' which contains the basic property information and sale/lease price. But you can't actually go to CoStar and see your listing unless you pay somewhere in the range of $600-1200 a month for CoStar access. So professional brokerages mostly use it to generate leads and track market data, while paying enormous sums of money to do this. You are required to call every single person in your portfolio once a month, and speak to them for 90 seconds following the script. Easy, right? Well, sort of. Not at all, really. You see, you'll only have about 180-200 of these contacts. Management has decided that you need to make about 20 calls a day to show that you're really performing. If you can do basic math, you will realize the problem here. 20 calls a day for 20 working days a month would be....400? But oh, it gets better, because a great number of your contacts don't want to speak to you. You see, they've been called once a month for a year or so, and still haven't sold their little corner shop. In fact, the only people they've ever heard from have been CoStar employees, who ask them the same questions about the size, price, and age of the building over, over, over, and over again. So they're not actually super invested in talking to you for 90 seconds. Maybe they say ""Oh hey, yeah, everything's the same as last time"" and hang up. Congrats! You get NOTHING for that call. Better try again. Or get someone else on your team to call them and pretend like you're out of the office and hope that a fresh voice and stumbling through the same set of questions like it's the first time will buy enough time to get a completed call. And then we get to clients. Professional brokerages are pretty serious operations. You'll have the brokers themselves, office support staff (or 'admins' in the CoStar parlance), finance, property management, etc. But these brokers are busy, and generally have their office staff manage and upload their listings. The brokers are so busy in fact, that they'd really rather you NOT call them while they're driving around meeting clients, doing showings, and scouting leads. In big name brokerages, CoStar is a major lead generator, and is thus professionally handled by a few office staff. But CoStar can't be bothered with the petty realities of business. Sure, the office staff draft the leasing agreements, put all the comparables into the company systems to determine commission, etc. But this is ignored, in favor of the possibility of getting the broker on the phone and hearing about all the juicy 'deals' they're doing. Since CoStar harasses, upsells, and overcharges all these brokers with an entirely different set of TWO sales teams who are also calling them all the time, they are unsurprisingly not interested into talking to use for the most part, and attempt to redirect calls to their administrative and support staff. CoStar will tell you to ignore these protestations, and to call them over and over and over again desperately trying to babble enough to get them to speak to you for 90 seconds. These questionable tactics aren't secret either. These are 'strategies' regularly encouraged by floor managers, who do a pretty good job of imitating robots themselves. ""I know all your people in your portfolio are hanging up on you and not picking up and screaming at you, but you're going to need to think of a way to get more calls."" A classic is to call back on every email you receive, forcing the sender to then explain and repeat the request to you over the phone. Then call them when its done and talk to them for another 90 seconds. The best part is that you have a freaking leaderboard, so every second of every day you're aware of how you're 'under-performing.' The secret of success, therefore, is to be lucky or to cheat. If you're lucky enough to have a port of willing brokers who will tolerate you calling them all the time for every minor thing, then congratulations! You will be lauded and treated like some kind of nascent god-child. Even more so if you make sure to call into other peoples' accounts when they're sick, out of work, or late. Or just do it anyway when they're at lunch. These are the so called 'top performers' who will literally be given cash prizes for taking your work, while you sit and fruitlessly dial the phone over and over and over again. Earlier, I mentioned promotions. The good news is that because CoStar can't hold onto employees to save its life, you can be promoted very quickly! In fact, if you're a good little robot and do nothing but brand, hammer the phones, and exercise as little free will as possible, you will rapidly promoted over the heads of people far more experienced and skilled with the product than you are! This creates a bizarre Kafka-esque ""The Office"" scenario where floor managers cannot actually give answers or provide guidance on technical questions or issues for their underlings. The manager's job is to audit all the work you do, so they can make sure you're not wasting a single precious second of company time. Ah yes, I forgot to mention that CoStar is one of THOSE companies, where surfing the web for a few minutes or looking at your phone is forbidden, and will get you a stern talking to the first time, followed quickly by threats of unemployment. In fact, there are so many audits that need to be done that CoStar doubled its management staff to hire more people to do all the audits. So now, instead of making calls, you just get to listen to dozens of your former peers making calls, while grading them on a (and I do not exaggerate, dear reader) 56-page rubric to score it. So there you go. CoStar in a nutshell. I could go on, of course, fueled by bitter resentment and catharsis. But I think you get the gist. Don't work here. It's pretty terrible.","1.0

It is interesting, however, that many of the negative comments I've read in these reviews are carbon copies of those I heard in the early 2000s - toxic environment, emphasis on metrics, poor communication, disdain for non-senior level employees, very little/no professional growth opportunities, shifting directives based on the Andy's latest whim, not knowing if today would be your last, and on and on and on. I saw committed employees - good, solid people - fired for the most ridiculous reasons you could imagine. The best analogy I've ever heard about working for CoStar came from someone who worked there (sales) much longer than I did.

This company does not value its employees. They do not listen to employee suggestions or complaints. They think they know what’s best but they are not in the research position and actually have no clue. This is NOT research. It is a call center and borderline telemarketing. The data is not accurate because the higher ups just want you to continually call and harass brokers all day every day instead of doing any research. They make impossible metrics so that you literally don’t have any time to do actual research or provide quality data since you’re back to back calling and saying stupid branding statements that make you sound like a robot. Their metrics are physically impossible to meet and the only way anyone meets them is bycheating. Yes, every one cheats here just so they don’t get fired. And the biggest cheaters? They get rewarded, glorified and promoted. This place is a JOKE. I have been at the company for years and I have yet to meet one person who enjoys their job as a research associate. Every day people are talking about how bad they want to quit and how much they hate their jobs. It is very obvious to spot the fake reviews that management writes on here. They do write fake reviews so be careful. Stay away at all costs for your own mental health and well-being.

The health, dental, and vision insurance are great. Retirement is good too with company match up to 4%, but you have to stay for 4 or 5 years to fully retain their match.","I can only speak for the Field Research Department, but things have gone downhill very fast in my year and a half at the company. Initially CoStar reels you in with grandiose ideas and talks about things that can be done and how utilized and meaningful your job will be. This is all a lie. While CoStar has endless means and can afford whatever they desire, the money is usually not allocated to the employees. Money is spent on needless things, while employees are asked to cut corners on the equipment used for creating content that is being sold as ""professional"". The second, and major issue to me, is that the company culture is less than desirable, and that is putting it politely. Being a grown adult you expect to have a little bit of freedom and responsibility to do your job. Not at CoStar. You constantly feel like you are under a microscope and having your every move watched. I absolutely understand why a company would want to monitor their employees, but CoStar takes it to another, unnecessary, level. All of the work and tasks you are given as an employee are insulting and degrading, in my opinion. As well, I feel as if my opinion doesn't matter on anything, even when asked. This creates a lackluster and negative culture. Thirdly, upper management is constantly changing what its desires are. One minute you will be told to do a task a certain way, then a minute later it will be wrong. There is no sense of direction as to where the department is heading. This creates a very frustrating work environment for all employees. If you enjoy the cliche environment of how a massive corporation works, then this place is for you. If you want to take pride in your work and feel like you're making an impact, then stay away.","1.0

You are sent emails each hour with data saying how many calls each person in your team has made thus far and length of those calls and are ranked accordingly. This happens every hour of every day. God forbid you have the lowest numbers of your team for 1 hour and you get a stern talking to. Unrealistic expectations. This company and position has so much potential but it is squandered by management. I still have friends that work here because they don't know what else to do and literally nothing has changed.

I have been here over three months and have zero understanding of the organizational structure or how products get built around here.

You get to interface with the top industry professionals within your book of business. If you’re looking to break into commercial real estate, it’s a great opportunity to build relationships and recognition with local movers and shakers.","The base pay is laughable. Commission is how you make money at CoStar and expect no work life balance if you plan to achieve that. 12-hour days and putting in 4-8 hours on weekends is the norm if want to be successful. The hustlers were okay with this while the commissions rewarded the effort. That’s no longer the case. We had a temporary spike in sales that was caused by the elimination of a competing service. Executives used this as an opportunity to justify a 40% quota increase along with a complete restructuring of the comp plan. Even if you can maintain the same percent of quota attainment, the new structure will pay out at almost half of the previous plan. They’ve also started withholding commission on what they regard as “bad deals”. Commission were being pulled before they clearly defined what constituted a non-commissionable sale. Implementing and penalizing the reps for failing to meet poorly communicated guidelines is par for the course at CoStar. The majority of these decisions are being made with one thing in mind, wall street. With the economic downturn in sight, this is a play to show continued profitability and to compensate the executives at the detriment of the sales force. CoStar is known as the 800-pound gorilla when it comes commercial real estate data providers. Our core group of clients are with us out necessity and not by choice. They view the company as a monopoly and have bad tastes in their mouths over recent changes. Although most of these changes are justifiable, it’s become completely demotivating to defend an organization that doesn’t look after its own. Commissions and withholding pay aside, lately the CEO has been putting an emphasis on client meeting metrics that do very little further sales. Although we need to be more present with existing clients, that's not achieved by forcing the reps to bother our already busy customers with unsolicited drop-ins and schwag hand outs. It's also been putting us in the position to deny issuing immediate remote assistance. Instead we push for unnecessary (and often unwelcomed) in person meetings. In short, unless conditions change, I would not recommend this job to a new hire and I don’t see many of the top performers sticking around either. Those of us who used our tenure to understand commercial real estate, and how CoStar’s information is used to make money in the industry, were previously handcuffed by the comp plan. That’s no longer the case.","1.0

Training is paid in full including hotel, food, etc. If you do not live in Richmond, VA. It thought me about a work environment I never want to be in again.","If you truly value quality over quantity, this place is not for you. It is SO metric driven that it becomes toxic. It does not matter how hard you work, or how good your work is, if your numbers do not match up with that month's unrealistic metrics your name will be paraded on the bottom of lists ( office e-mails and huge TV monitors around the office) for everyone to see. You will feel torn between providing good customer service vs. harassing clients, focusing on amount of dials and calls vs. adding properties onto the system, e-mails vs. random projects, and all while being micromanaged. ALL calls are recorded or dropped into, even if they are not allowed to record in your market or jurisdiction. It seems that every month there is a new metric to hit, and upper management does not care how you do it as long as you get it done. However, don't be caught cheating the system because you WILL get fired while the person who does cheat and doesn't get caught get's recognition. Did I mention that your calls are TIMED? If your call is less than one minute and thirty seconds, kiss that update with the client bye because it WILL NOT count as a call, it WILL NOT count towards your contact update frequency, and you WILL have to harass that person some other time within the month to get credit for that update. You will have to deal daily with things that do not make sense such as launching a new system that allows clients to add their on listings, but still having a listing added metric of at least 3 per day. The job is so demoralizing. It does not do justice to the title of ""Researcher"", it is just a over glorified call center, and this is the reason why turnover is so high. People only talk about how miserable they are and how bad they want to leave the company. Quality work is not recognized, and I know this first hand because a DIRECTOR told me this. She literally told me that it did not matter how fast I had moved up, or how good my work was, I did not deserve a higher merit increase because I did not have the knowledge (uhh..if that makes sense?). The culture at this place is despicable. If you do not share the predatory capitalistic mindset that the company values, you will be miserable.

There is absolutely zero room for growth at this company. You will sit with a headset on at your desk for 5 years before any kind of change in your career. You are treated like a child. You cannot look at your phone, talk to colleagues, or anything unless you are in a designated ""common room area."" Feedback you provide from your clients will never go further than your manager. Once again they operate on a ""take it or leave it"" attitude. No body knows what is going on or how to fix anything EVER. There is a huge disconnect across all departments. You reach out to one department to fix something and they tell you to reach out to another and so on. After 5 months of back and forth maybe it will get fixed or your client will have already blocked your number and canceled their subscription. Keep in mind you will still be required to call them every month. Honestly I could go on and on. This place is horrible and an embarrassment to have on your resume since the industry hates CoStar.

The executive team gets extremely wealthy off raising the stock price while the employees that get the company to their historic revenue are constantly crushed. This company thrives on a shark tank atmosphere. They want employees to be hungry and fight each other for scraps. There is NO team atmosphere. There are constant disputes between reps on territory boundaries and rules of engagement. When there is a rules of engagement dispute, middle management will typically pick their favorite employee as the winner. There is constant burn out amongst employees. At our last sales conference, I sat at a table with about 6 other reps - every single one of us was on blood pressure or anxiety meds or both. On one conference call, the head of sales disclosed that the average tenure for a sales rep was less than one year. Metrics are completely unrealistic and do not help you reach your sales goals. You spend 90% of your month checking boxes that help you sell nothing. There is constantly shifting fire drills when Andy will get on a new rant, and the entire sales team is expected to stop everything they’re doing and go check some crazy box Andy has come up with. There is absolutely nothing done to retain long term sales employees. There is no career path. The culture is made so that you must be stressed, on your toes at all times, or you will be easily replaced by someone younger and hungrier. It is a constant state of hunger games.","1.0

You meet great people - and yes there are cons as there are with every job - but the people make it worth it.,The biggest con of Costar is that they are still struggling to find the best way to measure the work of the research associates. Currently it is based off of your call numbers and portfolio update goal (percentage of people in your portfolio that you speak with for more than a minute an 30 seconds every month). I will say - in my year and a half at Costar it has come a long way. What is still lacking is the quality in the research. Call audits are not encouraging the quality. Sorry but it just doesn't work like that - it just gives off a big brother vibe. I think that Costar sometimes forgets that the researchers so actually care about the database and WANT to do real solid reasearch. Passing up quality research for making your numbers every month is why a lot of people have an issue with working here. And most people do not regret their time here - Costar opens a lot of doors for your future - but I think the researchers want to make the database better but do not have the opportunity to do so.,"3.0

In a nutshell, it’s a cancer. There are two offices Terminus and Phipps. Terminus houses primarily apartments.com. If you are college educated and looking for career advancement within the company then the apartments.com sector is not for you. It’s moreso a pit stop for a new graduate or someone between jobs. It’s a call center with call center metrics. No matter how they try to sell it to you. Apparently, the college educated, growth and career advancement is all housed in the Phipps office. Imagine the newest director ( I saw 6 in my 2.5 years there), who came from the Phipps office acknowledging the Terminus office as the “hood”. Terminus is unanimously referred to as the hood, the plantation and any other derogatory adjective you may think of. The work culture is very poor. And it definitely starts with the team managers. They are college graduates with little to no experience in management. Hiring a chemist graduate in an Architecture position does what good? They themselves do not even care or take their position serious. Guidelines are not respected or enforced. Remodeling the Terminus office to mirror the upscale Phipps office does nothing for the work culture just like everyone knows you can’t outrun a bad diet. Overall, there is no stability.","2.0

If you work as any kind of support staff, there will be little to no opportunity of moving up. Managers and executives will be curt with you at best, and from time-to-time downright nasty or even abusive. You will be blamed for things out of your control. No bonuses, no cost of living increase, and you will be underpaid. The job description reflects maybe 1/4 of all the work that you will be doing (I was handling like 3 different jobs, on top of being a support staff for a number of different people), and additional responsibility will be added ""because it looks good on your resume."" If you have suggestions, they will be probably be ignored. Decisions are often arbitrary, and made with the bottom line in mind, so departments are constantly being cut despite the growth of the company. As a result of these constant growth, the products of acquired companies change, become buggy or unreliable as they are integrated into the CoStar system, and you have to deal with very unhappy customers. Every department is at the whim of upper management, and there have been many changes to the products which in part is due to cutting staff and rearranging departments. It seems that many people in various departments are always looking for another job. It's too bad, because CoStar hires some very intelligent people, but they quickly learn after starting that everything is up in the air here, even their job description.

Good health, dental and vision insurance plans. Strict 40 hour work week (although you may be working a market in a different time zone).","It's similar to a call center. You will be expected to make around 70 to 80 calls a day when you start and will have to get at least 15 or so to be 90 seconds long - if the call isn't 90 seconds it basically never happened. You have to get 85% of the people on your list to call on the phone for 90 seconds every month - if you call and they shout nothing has changed and hang up, get ready to call them back again and have them even more angry - then enjoy calling them again in 3 or 4 weeks. Most everyone you speak with hates all of the calls and does not want to talk with you and I don't blame them - you are asking them the same thing every month and trying to pepper in ridiculous ""branding statements"" you are required to say and asking largely useless questions that you probably already have the answer to in order to keep them on the phone for 90 seconds. You keep calling these people until they answer and the sales people call them too . It's very repetitive, very boring and at the end of they day you are relying on these folks to answer the phone and talk to you to keep your job. Training is fine but you are learning the absolute basics of real estate (most of the training is making phone calls and learning how to enter data into CoStar software. Turnover is very high and there is lots of shuffling people around. The office is nice but folks are packed in like sardines. You sit at a small desk, wear a headset and make calls all day. You are compensated well for this but you may lose your sanity after a little while - hence why turnover is so high even with the solid pay for a twenty something kid with a degree in basket weaving from Radford. All calls are recorded and you will be ""audited"" about every other day - i.e. your manager will listen to your call to make sure you ""branded"" multiple times asked the same questions you have to ask every month and make sure you're not just dialing through phone trees or leaving long voice mails to get your 90 second call. Definitely not for everyone - think hard before accepting a ""research"" position about what the shelf life is for a job making phone calls to angry people all day is for you.","1.0

You are told it is research and led to believe that you will call, retrieve and enter data points on commercial real estate. But it's not. It's a CALL CENTER stocked with (at the time I was there) very smart, well educated people stuck doing demeaning dial outs to get anyone with a pulse on the phone. Yes, ideally it should be a broker but they block your number. (and the company employs another company to ""spoof"" your number to have the same area code as the area you call...you are essentially becoming those people you hate that call you!) They want you to call early and often and the cell....sorry if they are in church, a hospital or in bed. Just call later. Why restraining orders aren't taken I don't know...it is truly warranted. We are told numerous times ( I know I was and other were) to ""remove my name"" from the call list. Sorry...call back again the next month regardless. Other way to get around it is they re-assign the portfolio - new unknown phone number and naive person reaching out. Yes.,..many of us have been cussed out. But that's fine....as long as you HIT YOUR NUMBERS. You MUST make the calls. 15-20 depending on your port. Doesn't matter if the math doesn't work (as I pointed out to my manager) of X amount of brokers divided by Y days doesn't come close to getting that number even if all of them did answer! So lets say you get a high profile portfolio which should mean you have arrived...Yikes. You definitely will not get these brokers on the phone...they have underlings that take those calls. They will block your number. Their admins will keep your mailbox full of changes to prices, comps, changes etc but you have to save that for later. You have to get those 15-20 calls somehow. Oops...it's 5pm...no OT so save it for the next day.! That is the M.O.....every day. The call metrics outweigh the data. SO many times I received ports that were not kept up to date to the ire of the admins and brokers because the poor sap who previously had it never had time to add in information. Ironic huh? It's a company that sells the data. But do not fear...now the brokers who subscribe can enter their own info so not exactly sure why they have researchers now. Oh wait...that's to field the calls from the irate customers for when things are wrong or screwed up! And I did mention great people to work with....but don't get too attached. I watched too many led to the door with a box of personal items in hand. Demoralizing. Many I worked with had illnesses likely stress related ....shingles, stomach problems and headaches. Some went out for long periods of time, left or came back to no more desk. If you are gone for any long period you are re-assigned elsewhere. Very impersonal. Others tried to cheat the system by leaving too many voicemails (fired), calling friends (fired) or other to try to make the metrics. Creativity abounds when it comes to this. All researchers will tell you that anyone who makes their number has either a low level port with many many landowners who will answer or cheats the system in some way. Turnover is rampant and not through firings. That should be a loud message to management but amazingly it is not acknowledged. I started with 30 in my training class. A year later there are 11 left. I know of 4 others who left just in the past week. What kind of company finds that acceptable? What kind of company values employees to an extent that turnover to that degree is not viewed with alarm?? It speaks volumes....so if you are thinking of Costar just walk in with your eyes open. It IS a call center. You will have 15-20 BROKERS (admins and others DO NOT count) to call each day even though realistically you only have about 10 per day you could call. People will constantly leave. They will move you around on a whim (oh yea...it's like a sports teams. If you do hit those numbers you will be at risk of being switched to a different team. Had a manager actually tell me this. They are evaluated on their team average so their managers encourage moving the hi average people over to help out less performing teams). Expect to be judged by appearance. Young and pretty gets sent to shows and meetings...doesn't matter your experience. (but hey....they tell you Andy does have a ""type"") Yes...great money but anyone you speak to who has worked there will say it is NOT WORTH IT. You are supposed to be happy AND proud of what you do .... talking to Costar clients will not make you either. Your are bugging the snot out of them no differently than the telemarketers that call you. Have some decency and self respect. Just say no.","1.0

Great work life balance for hourly employees. Beautiful office, free gym access, commuter benefits, free lunch. I legitimately enjoyed working with everyone on my team. CoStar hires good folks with loads of talent.","Calling is your raison d'être. Honestly. It is a simple premise: you're given a ""portfolio"" of a certain number of contacts with commercial real estate listings, and you call them once a month to get updates, missing details, new listings, and info about transactions. It is not inherently difficult. Except this all comes with a few caveats. 1. There will be contacts in your portfolio who do not want you to call. They would either prefer to communicate via email or better yet, would prefer you eat dog food and bark at the moon. They really don't want you to call. You will call them. They might say to speak with their administrator or assistant. You will still call them. Usually their listings impact analytics, so the most accurate thing is to update per their website or confirm with a nearby tenant, but you don't get that all important call, despite having done legitimate research. 2. The total of required calls sometimes far exceeds the number of contacts in a portfolio. Some portfolios have like 200 contacts. At 20 work days per month, someone can make ten calls per day. You need to make at least 15. 3. Management uses quantitative metrics without regards to important qualitative aspects of assessing a researcher. The metrics are in place to grade researchers against their peers. You can't measure relationships with numbers. You can't measure asking thoughtful questions and getting insightful answers when conducting interviews with brokers. You can only count the number of ninety second interviews. And what percentage of your contacts you have had an interview with. Again, that's it, nothing matters if it doesn't involve a ninety second interview. So much so, that those numbers are on display on boards everywhere. And emailed to the teams, constantly. 4. You won't actually learn much about commercial real estate. You'll become familiar with common terms. You may even remember large deals or know the names of large companies. You will not learn trends by asset class or by submarket. At best you'll learn what important questions to ask when discussing listings and transactions. You won't even learn how to use the product to search for and understand the analytics you sell to clients. Those things don't get phone calls. Seriously, you really just need to make as many calls as possible. 5. Pretty much anything that involves improving the accuracy or quality of the data is a distraction. And they only get in the way of what really matters, getting more phone calls.","1.0

Walking the halls of any research office you’ll quickly be able to tell that most of your coworkers are miserable and are searching for employment elsewhere. Also don’t believe anyone in HR who tells you that lateral movement across departments is possible, because you’re basically stuck in research. Maybe 10% of people actually get promotions, and those are people who “look” the part, meaning they’re young, and attractive. So if you’re past your prime. Good luck. I’d make it an effort to get in and out of this place within a year for office experience.

They do tell you in the interview that you will be making phone calls to your account. They in no way, shape, or form, tell you that calling is your only job function. They require you to make twenty, 90 second calls per day to a portfolio of people that you call everyday. Overall, they expect 80 calls per day and only 20 have to count. Think outbound telemarketer. They then publically display your call stats and rank you amongst your peers. The turnover rate is very high as people soon realize that they did not just spend an astronomical amount of money on school to work at an outbound call center collecting real estate data. It's literally a revolving door at CoStar. Don't expect to be able to transfer your skills unless you are looking at other call center opportunities. Also, the salaries for a Research Associate are a flat rate. There is zero room for negotion. So if you have a Masters and work experience, you make just as much as a fresh college grad with zero experience. It is definitely a degrading feeling to know that they do not value your education or experience.

This is essentially a call-center. You call (harass) tenants all day every day and ask them questions about their location, lease terms, rent, services, etc. , enter it in a database to then sell to brokers and companies for an ungodly rate. The work is monotonous. The managers put such emphasis on #s (legit hashtags--the goal when I left was at 48 #s per day and 25 1-min long ""interviews"") that quantity is valued over quality. People cheat and they are rewarded while others gather legit data and are penalized for not reaching the quota. Management watches the amount of calls, the minutes between the calls, how long the calls lasted then grade you (QA) on random calls. Which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that there are 404 points to lose but the lowest score you can get is a 0 and the highest is 100 (HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?) Upper management is so far removed it's laughable. They will walk the floors and complain out loud that they don't hear enough people dialing/calling. They also have these idiotic boards every where that are supposed to show the # of tenants researched, # of calls made, and # of interviews but the #s are random and don't make sense much like this company. If you're thinking of applying here and you're reading the reviews thinking ""oh it can't be THAT bad."" It is. Truly. Do yourself a favor and keep looking. No amount of money is worth this amount of stress, anxiety and unhappiness. TL;DR I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy and that's saying a lot because referral bonuses are $1500.","1.0

There is no research as a ""research associate"". This is a glorified call center where you will be expected to make at least 80 calls a day, trying to talk to at least 20 people for more than 90 seconds each call. It is very metrics based. If your calls are less than 90 seconds they don't count. If you communicate with someone by email it doesn't count. The company cares less about research and acquiring information, and more about just unabashedly branding itself. You must constantly brand the company using a bunch of statistics multiple times during each call, so naturally, most people think you are trying to sell them something, and usually hang up on you immediately. It feels very slimy and a bit shady and definitely degrading. You will be hung up on constantly, often times yelled at because the company keeps calling the same people at least once a month (often times multiple times a month, especially in training) just to verify the same information over and over again. You are literally just harassing people about the company nonstop, calling them repeatedly on every number they have - at home, their cell, work, multiple times a day. The work is very competitive and fosters an environment where the people at the top (who make the most successful calls) are constantly praised, while the people at the bottom (who can't get someone to answer the phone or who don't want to talk to them) are told to find more effective ways to get the job done. They make it out to be your fault if people don't want to talk to you or won't answer the phone the 6 times in a day you call. Also, all your calls are recorded (where state law allows) and your computer screen is recorded as well, so they can know what you say and what you're doing on the call. It's very big brother and invasive, there's no privacy whatsoever, and a constant fear of being replaced if you can't meet the quota for your calls. The money is not worth the loss of sanity and dignity that comes with the job.","1.0

Setting aside job duties, CoStar is a nice place to work. Research Associates are paid well, you never take work home, and you'll learn a lot about commercial real estate. If I could have transferred to a different position within the company then I would have gladly stayed at CoStar.","Research is a call center. It's a well paid call center, and it's not telemarketing, but it's a call center. Performance metrics frequently change, poor communication regarding changes. Highly repetitive work, very little analysis or creativity required. The company has decided that the best way to gather data is by having a conversation with every broker, every month. Honestly, I agree. The problem is that it is an ideal result and ideal results are hard to achieve. Some brokers have neither the time nor the inclination to have a detailed call each month. It's tough to have a quality conversation with a busy broker when they know you're not buying, they had the same conversation last month, and they're not a CoStar client. Brokers frequently ask researchers not to call, or to call administrative assistants, or to email. However, metrics require researchers to have a phone conversation with the broker and therefore these requests are often ignored. Most researchers do the best they can to keep things civil while also hitting their metrics, meaning they email an admin for the bulk of the data then place a (sometimes meaningless) call to the broker and pretend to have some clarifying questions in order to speak long enough for the call to register. Additionally, there are frequent changes to how the metrics are calculated. Managers can't, or won't, explain how some metrics are calculated. It is incredibly disheartening when a manager cannot explain why a call didn't flow through to the metrics correctly, especially when their best advice is to make up a reason to call back tomorrow. Most of all, you start to feel like quality work for actual clients is discouraged. There's very little incentive to work on client requests when the only praise and rewards come from hitting call metrics. At the end of the day, anyone can simply get by in this job. If you want to excel, you can't care about what the brokers think or say about you. You have to be willing to get chewed out by a broker in July and then call them every day for two weeks in August until they answer. You have to be willing to dial 80, 90, 100 times every day to hit your numbers. Brokers, even clients, will block your number, hang up as soon as they hear CoStar, or swear at you. Your manager will expect you to start dialing as soon as you punch in and to keep dialing until you hit your metrics, regardless of whether you finished your data entry and client requests from yesterday.","3.0

Metrics are a joke 2. Professionally humiliating to work here 3. Managers can manipulate your success and failure Metrics- Goal is to have a 90 second phone call with everyone in your ""portfolio"" once per month. You are instructed not to call anyone back directly until the next month if you have already spoken to them via the phone, and the call lasted more than 90 seconds. Personally, I only had 250 people in my portfolio, I informed my manager it was mathematically impossible to interview 17 people per day (the goal during my time of employment), and only talk with each person in my portfolio once per month as instructed. (250 people, 23 working days in that particular month (250/23) averages out to less than 11 per day). My manager's response: ""Honestly, you're just really over thinking it: To hit your goal, you need to call 17 people per day, and speak with everyone in your portfolio once per month. That's all there is to it, the math on it has no direct implication to you hitting that goal."" Other favorite lines: Manager: ""No one is answering your calls today, you really need more effective dialing"" ""I understand you can't control if someone answers your phone calls or requests to be emailed as opposed to called, but it's just what this job is so you need to ignore their preferences and have our clients be angry. Keep leaving voicemails. Portfolios can be manipulated by managers, you can leave on Friday at 80% and come back on Monday at 70%, Managers can add new people or remove people as they please. Best example, I had a friend who had to be at 83% by the EOD or he would be fired. He comes in that morning to find out he had magically gone down 5% overnight, and in his portfolio Bed, Bath & Beyond and Advanced Laser Clinic were somehow added to his portfolio as active brokerage firms with properties and land listings for sale....Interesting if you ask me.","1.0

Andy is an irascible, mercurial, vindictive leader that believes in humiliating, intimidating, and debasing his colleagues in front of others. Despite his stature, Andy terrifies the executive leadership on down. People are even afraid to openly acknowledge Andy's behavior and only reference him to others with cryptic whispers. Andy blames all of the company's shortcomings on the people around him, which is ironic because he doesn't allow virtually any decisions to be made without his approval. Andy is the King Joffrey of CEOs. If you've ever had to use a CoStar product, you know Andy doesn't know how to run a technology company. The technology stack is a massive dinosaur of obsolete bandaids-on-bandaids. I am sure that many of the higher-ups are actually talented but their single most important skill is surviving at CoStar. Almost all of the leadership has worked at CoStar their entire careers so they have never had exposure to real leadership. Andy was worst rated CEO in DC on Glassdoor in 2013 and he had a meltdown. After that came out, you can see that there was some pressure to improve the reviews of CoStar/Andy.

They speak the truth. Upper management doesn't care about your morale nor do they care about your career progression. As soon as a research begins their job and they realize what menial work they will be doing, they start searching for another job. This is a call center. You will do nothing but call. No critical thinking involved. No real ownership of project. No real discernible skills to brag about, honestly anyways, on your resume. This job is a huge waste of time if you can get another job in CRE and want to stay in CRE. We make clients consistently upset with needless and incessant branding and calling. Upper mgmt grades us based off metrics that are draconian at best and that have no real footing in reality. They treat researchers in the different departments Tenant, Portfolio, and Multi-family quite differently. Tenant gets paid more even though they do the same essential calling tasks. IT is a new department but they didn't do that for the multi-family department. Atlanta doesn't even get monetary incentives and hardly has any morale boosting events. It is almost like they have been relatively forgotten. Management is terrible and untrustworthy, probably because they are feeling the same pain as researchers are. Upper mgmt of research falls in line behind whatever Andy says - even if it doesn't make any sense on the ground (branding and such), It is a terrible, terrible job. If you graduated college, you deserve better than a menial call-center job where your worth is based off dumb metrics. You might get promoted three times, but you will still be calling, calling, calling. IF you want to wake up depressed and regretting a career decision, then choose CoStar Group.

As many have said below me, the metrics are extremely unrealistic, especially the higher you go in portfolio. This was something we discussed over lunch literally every day I was working there, so I know I wasn't the only one who felt this way. They try to claim not to focus on the metrics, if you just do your job, the call numbers will happen naturally. Not at all true. There were days where I made 80-90 phone calls, and still only had 9 ""quality"" (minute and a half long) conversations. I had plenty of clients who vastly preferred to communicate via email, and would give me all the information I needed, and yet they still didn't count towards my update frequency unless I also gave them an unnecessary phone call just to check, which usually pissed them off. They also change so many of their methods so quickly, it's hard to keep up. I understand that a company is constantly growing, but when you are taught something in your training, and the next training class (one week later) is taught the complete opposite, you're going to have a problem.","1.0

I'll leave it at that.","Let me offer a snapshot into the soul of the Research Department. While this example may appear dated, nothing has changed. If anything, the culture within this Department has worsened. Years ago, after New Jersey was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, Our Team, despite severe objections by team members, was forced to call our market. Every day, a Researcher is expected to make an insurmountable pile of calls, and according to the Research Department, this day was like any other. Families were without homes, businesses were crippled, the state was in shock — but we were told we had to burden them with our daily metrics. Do not for one second think that our scripts were abridged to incorporate any human feeling. Our goal was to ask the same questions, harass the same people. Here is how I remember the typical script from that day: RA: “Good afternoon Mr. Smith, this is XYZ from CoStar Group, how is everything?” VICTIM: “I can’t talk my home is underwater and my business is a mile off the Jersey shore.” RA: “Well, do you have any other listings on the market?” VICTIM: “You’re kidding…” RA: “No, I’m not kidding, sir, I take my job seriously. We’re the #1 provider of commercial real estate. Have you heard of our subsidiary LoopNet?” VICTIM: “You do understand that our community is in a State of Emergency?” RA: “I just want to provide maximum exposure to your listings.” You get the picture. Scripts and bureaucracy are more important than actual human feeling. I know that sounds like a cliche, but I have worked for many other organizations and CoStar takes this notion to new definitions of the word. Hannah Arendt had a term for this. She called it the ‘Banality of Evil’. It means that in going along with what you are told, as Managers, Directors and above do, they create an atmosphere of immorality, and are capable of tacitly carrying out horrible acts. While this alludes to unspeakable atrocities over 70 years ago, the underlying psychology persists in vile, seemingly benign corporate gutters like CoStar Group’s Research Department.","1.0

I was discouraged from offering ideas about increasing productivity. Everyone feels like they can get fired at any moment for little or no reason (warranted: they fire lots of people daily), but it makes people unwilling to make decisions. Managers will tell you to do one thing on the phone, and then write the opposite in an email to cover their butt by having something it writing.

Perhaps, if you work as a Research Associate here, after knowing the epitome of awfulness, your future decision-making will be better going forward.","The word ‘research’ should not be in the job title. It does not matter what industry this is – you are dealing with individual data points and have absolutely no association with a larger picture of real estate or markets. Your ‘research’ mostly includes google, maybe a couple government websites, and cross-referencing individual data points on our own websites. If you ever took a research methods class you will quickly learn that the definition of research at CoStar greatly differs from what you had learned it to be. And primarily, you are calling, calling, calling, calling – calling those who mostly have better things to do. And since your training involves little more than basic knowledge of anything in the industry, and you are used to being belittled on the phone, you come off as a scared buffoon. You will learn very (very) rudimentary basics of commercial real estate – and that is where the resume builders end. As we were explained to after a company wide survey (the results of which made it vividly clear that 1. No Research Associate believes there is any career growth and 2. Senior Management is awful), you learning new skills (SQL, Excel, Economics/Finance of RE) is not a business need. Although this may be true, people should not be treated as cattle. As with many businesses, concessions are made to employees to foster happiness. And I’m not talking about money – I’m referring to helping people develop careers. Further, is it not a smart business decision to maximize the knowledge of your employees? Every tweak to the research process introduces a new mind-numbing task. Research Associates are prevented from learning any new skills or learning about anything in their market. Literally, your job is data entry, following scripts, and smiling – and I can’t emphasize this last point enough. Leadership is synonymous with the perception of an uppity-up personality. Include smiles, flamboyant language in your e-mails, drink-kool-aid, and tell everyone you had the most relaxing weekend (but it was too short, though!!), and you are on your way to Research Associate II! You can taste the repressed emotions on your tongue; the attuned psychologist would have a field day here. Let’s dive into the culture of anti-intellectualism, shall we? Any criticisms of the research process are greeted with some pre-packaged platitude. For instance, if you state that an over-emphasis on one metric is side-lining work on a different metric, a common rebuttal is, “Just try a little harder.” Or perhaps, “Start working right away; the early bird gets the worm!” You will NEVER see actual statistics with SOUND methodology that relate the best research practices. Perhaps because what you do here is not research. At least in the military you understand that there is some kind of purpose behind what you do.  I love the tag-line of CoStar’s website: “Knowledge Market.” You have to be kidding me. I’ll give you a perfect example to illustrate my concerns with this tag-line: About two years ago CoStar released a new analytical product that gave insights into CRE micro-markets. Research MANAGERS were responsible for initial edits of this content. They were only the initial editors for little over a few months. Why?  The Research Managers had no idea what was actually happening in their markets (DC, NY, Baltimore) and could offer no valuable feedback. The products were horrendous and apparently upper management was naïve enough to think that Research Managers are more than glorified cheerleaders. The Research Manager’s day consists of sending out e-mails such as “this guy has 15 calls already! Who can catch him?!” I am not joking. That is actually the childish motivating tactic used by most managers at the DC Center. That and standing up and bellowing, ""kind of quiet in here!"" Meaning you should pick up your phone and aimlessly call admins. Kind of similar to a 3rd grade classroom when the teacher walks in and says, ""why is it so loud in here?"" as a way of getting the room to quiet. Or other emails Managers send out telling you to not text while working -- I haven't had this kind of discussion since high school. You work a kind-of-job. You have no power, real responsibility, and are, at best, a half-realized supplement to any commercial real estate professional. Lets end this review off by calling you what you really are – a secretary’s secretary. Real Estate Companies hire secretaries to deal with you. 90% of your client’s needs is extraordinarily rudimentary -- basic data points that 3rd graders can communicate to you. However, management will tell you that what you do is ‘so complex’ and brokers ‘need’ to speak with you.' False. And further, when brokers tell you that their firm has hired someone to deal with you and they don’t have time for you, and you tell your manager this, you will get the hose again. The CoStar responses on Glassdoor have been a real treat. “CoStar is fast-paced!” or “We’re constantly changing to make things better!” No. CoStar research is an impetuous and childish institution. If you loath creativity, are motivated by childish motivation tactics, and are okay with being a pawn – CoStar Research is the cubicle for you! Apply Today!","1.0

Let's do the math. If you talk to every contact in your port in 20 days of work for a month, that averages to 12.5- 15 calls a day and that is assuming EVERY person answers and talks to you for 1 min 30 seconds. Yet they still want you to average 20 calls a day which is by the numbers not possible. All they care about is calls, nothing else. Doesn't matter if you have a level 1 portfolio or level 3 portfolio, where clients pay you a lot of money to see correct and accurate information, they just want you to make calls.

The benefits are also top notch. The office has a great view. The individuals you work with really care about their job, for the most part.

A researcher has to make a certain number of calls, starting first thing in the morning, while ignoring client requests, portfolio maintenance, and everything that the company claims to sell. Though you are allowed to clock out (so that your lack of time on the phone doesn't hurt your metrics) for larger projects, there is not enough time in the day to do the amount of work that upper management wants done. Recent metric changes have impacted the quality of data coming out of the company to the point where I do not see how it's sustainable without customers catching on. Branding is flat across the board, so that researchers are branding with the same script to customers who have been with the company for years and building owners in the middle of nowhere who don't have an email address let alone a knowledge of CoStar. On top of metrics researchers receive call evaluations which are entirely based on this branding. There is no relationship building in this job. It's just calls. Don't let them tell you it's ""all about balance"". It's all about calls (which most of the bigger clients hate anyways and you'll only talk to admins). I have watched multiple, more senior, researchers leave the office in tears. The stress is so intense it's a good thing we have great health benefits.","3.0

It is so bad that people literally do job applications while they are at work hoping and waiting for the day they get to turn in their two weeks. It is a shame, really. At one point the job was great but since about a year ago, it was went south full speed ahead. They even did an employee satisfaction survey and they said we would find out the results -- turns out the results were so bad they didn't want to release them...and things still haven't changed. Also, promotions are a joke here. There are three levels of researcher from research associate 1, RA2, then senior research associate. Here is the kicker...it's all the same job but just pays different. It takes 2-3 years to get SRA yet you don't get any added responsiblity. CoStar doesn't konw how to use their talent so their talent just goes away.","1.0

In the past 3 months the firm has promoted an absurd culture of over branding, job insecurity, and fear of executive management. Prior to that, the job was straight forward: contact brokers, add to the database, provide customer service. There were metrics, but they weren't aggressively enforced - now one week of not meeting them on average puts you on the chopping block. Expectations are incredibly hard to meet for some portfolios, yet all are expected to meet them despite vastly different workloads and services provided. Research processes are clunky and don't make sense, and the internal operating system is cumbersome and needs to be put down like a rabid animal. Upper management is completely out of touch with researchers day to day and implement changes without any consultation with researchers. Mid to lower management constantly micro-manage and audit their staff (they have little choice) which creates a big brother type of organization. This is supposedly for quality assurance, but creates another stressor since a few bad calls can put you on notice. Turnover is high for a reason: management does not care about you, your personal development, or your happiness. There has become a ""if you don't like it, you can leave"" approach to employee communication, of which there is little of to begin with.","2.0

It really captures most of the market, and the tools are fantastic. - TONS of people in the industry use CoStar, and having the experience with it gets you in a lot of doors - Your coworkers are amazing. Lots of young, motivated, pleasant people who make the job worthwhile. For a bit. - Free food, drinks, gym, etc. I think they know it's a terrible place to work, so they compensate? - Benefits and salary are insane. The amount they are paying for the work you do is astronomical. - Work/life balance is good. Hourly work, so you only work 8 hours. Sometimes allow overtime, which is some nice extra money.","- The entire organization is a ship without a captain. If there is a captain, they are running it right into an iceberg. There doesn't seem to be one unified company culture, and blaming that on acquisitions is passing the buck. Every office creates its own environment, and how things are done in one location is not how they are done elsewhere. This creates spotty data, and lowers their product. - Senior leadership is opaque at best, deceitful at worst. The leaders preach that there will be time to learn and grow in your role, but after only a month, new hires are expected to compete with employees who have been in the role for years. Further, they make decisions without sharing this knowledge, creating rumors which ultimately hurts their organizational culture. Everyone knows that no one trusts senior leadership, so rather than fixing that and increasing transparency, the organization opened a new office and paid the employees 20% more than those in DC. This does not foster trust. You cannot buy engagement. You cannot buy trust. - There is NO focus on career development at all. The heads of the organization don't care, because the role is easy and they can burn and turn people. But, when a senior member of the team is doing the same job as a brand new person with a different title, that's a problem. Training is focused only on new hire, once you leave you get no more guidance. - The management team wants to do well, but is not given the tools to do so. When SMEs are promoted to the role of manager, there has to be some training there. Just because you know how to balance your time and pay attention to detail does not mean you know how to inspire others to do the same. - The metrics are silly. I have no problem with a metrics-based environment, and I was a top performer when I was a researcher at CoStar. However, the numbers NOW are insane, and do not reflect reality. With the way the job is structured, it is impossible for anybody to achieve the number of 1 minute calls they want. The system they use is so outdated it takes 6 weeks to teach it, the employees have to open up the website for a company CoStar owns, log in almost each time, and then fruitlessly search for a property. How it doesn't happen automatically is beyond me. - all the above boils down to this: CoStar has never had a real competitor before. They have floated by on being the only, the biggest, and the first. Now, they have a real competitor and they have no idea how to handle it.","2.0

This is an entry level position only requires Bachelor Degree. You will probably like your coworkers and direct supervisors.,"Unfortunately none of the above will matter. The job itself is quite simple. Talk to people and do research to ensure product is accurate. However the metrics which is the main focus of your job will not allow you to ensure the product is correct. You will instead spend your day trying to get people to stay on the phone with you long enough to meet the ridiculous call goals. Instead of spending the time to research your market to make sure everything in the product is correct. People will complain about you calling monthly they will politely ask you to call less often or go to their website, they will hang up on you, they will curse you out, but it does not matter you will call them again next month. If you do not meet the metrics you will be fired. Every one there is scared that they will not have a job the next week due to not meeting the metrics which change monthly. There is no room for advancement. You will be so stressed out from work your life outside of work will suffer. Senior management is aware, they send out ""anonymous"" surveys but nothing changes. Your direct supervisor has no control neither do the managers over them. It all comes down from the top. Where their idea of fixing it, is sending out catch phrases to help ""brand"" the company better. In most cases these taglines are a misrepresentation (lie).","1.0

Free lunch, coffee, and onsite gym are a plus but it's all part of the system to reel you in. You will learn to cold call and deal with rejections on a daily basis.","Company is almost 30 years old yet it feels like it just opened its doors yesterday. The processes and ever changing metrics that are used make you feel like upper management has no idea what they are doing. The research managers act like they have been here for years yet they were hired the same time as everyone else. None of them started at the bottom like the rest of us and had to cold call hundreds of tenants a day to confirm information. Congratulations, you had limited managerial experience and that bumped you up the pay grade of everyone else. The type of work you do here is extremely repetitive and tedious. Everyday is the exact same thing. Call hundreds of business and confirm information. Not to mention you are phishing for data that most people are not willing to give out. You also have to pay to park in the garage and there is no other option other than parking several blocks away to avoid the cost. For a part time employee half your paycheck is going to just parking your vehicle. There is limited upward mobility and while you can eventually move up, if you have no managerial experience you are never moving out of the research department. No one becomes a manager starting in research and if you do it's because you got lucky. There are certainly better roles here and if you have managerial experience you can by pass all the hard work and watch others do it all day while you sit on your throne.","2.0

You will feel like you're under surveillance all the time. Seriously, part of me suspects CoStar is tracking these keystrokes right now. 4. There is a completely pointless culture of formality. I'm pretty sure people have been fired for not wearing a tie while enjoying the free Kool Aid and posting their fake reviews. 5. Everyone says the products are good, and I agree they are impressive.
