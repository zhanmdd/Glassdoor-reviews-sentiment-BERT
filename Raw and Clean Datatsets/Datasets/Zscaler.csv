This is turning out to be one of the top 2 places I've ever worked. The employees are what make it a fantastic experience. You go home and feel good about not only what you accomplished, but how you accomplished the job. It's still very much a start-up mentality with little to no politics, just good people focused on doing a great job without a lot of ego. However you want to measure success Zscaler has it - products, revenue, growth, disruptive technology, great place to work certification, and the list goes on.","I've read the negative reviews on here and honestly, I have not had the same experience. Sometimes makes me wonder if we work at the same company. Zscaler is what you make of it and certainly isn't for everyone. The pace is really fast and expectations are incredibly high. You have to be able to thrive (not just cope) in a founder led environment without a guidebook to tell you what to do all the time. Most of the cons I've experienced are growth related - having the tools and resources you need can be a challenge.","5.0

IPv6, DoH, TLS 1.3+ are all breaking platform functionality and increasing required workarounds - recently announced features are lame-ducks on delivery - ZDX is to reduce support ticket CASB functionality is feature poor, not competitive - Zscaler has technically smart people with zero understanding of effective enablement and a sales team which doesn't have any market understanding all the way through to having no basic IT skills - training and marketing material is focused on creating and delivering a message for delivery by the Zscaler CEO and no one else. Even master decks look like from 2013 and as a mix tape of other decks - this is a poor foundation as product expands and new hires are started. Execution erodes while personalities with little output fill the void of those who are fired or move on to something better - the IPO was successful and many employees lazy waiting for last heavily discounted ESPP payday - there are few paths for progression in any part of the organization that don't require office politics","3.0

You can have flexibility as far as ""face time hours"" in the office if you need it, but of course you are expected to get your work done regardless and behave responsibly. This place is not for everyone. If you're not that dedicated to your job, it's not for you. If your attitude is ""I work hard from 9am-6pm, but after that I shut it down and make it difficult for anyone to reach me,"" this place is not for you either. But if you have the passion and the dedication, and enjoy working with like-minded engineers in a (mostly) bureaucracy-free environment, I strongly recommend this company. Also, it's not all work and no play here. There are plenty of celebrations and fun events (on-site and off-site), formal and informal gatherings in the break areas, once-a-week free lunches, endless free snacks and drinks, etc. I think it's the right balance.","I have heard that the pay is just average for the Valley. But I cannot personally vouch for this, as I'm satisfied with my salary (no idea if I'm average or below-average) and don't know what others make either.","5.0

The technology is unmatched and we have no competition if the customer truly values security and understands the risk associated with running a legacy, hub-and-spoke network. I am extremely grateful the founders had the foresight and determination 10+ years ago to create a cloud-based security platform when everyone else called them crazy and were still trying to innovate boxes sitting in a data center. Now every data center box manufacturer is struggling to play catch up by offering half-baked “cloud solutions” that were never designed to be consumed as-a-Service. The experience and maturity of Zscaler gives us a massive competitive advantage, one that our competitors can’t overcome with even the most unnatural discounts. Add our recent IPO and acceleration into artificial intelligence/machine learning with the TrustPath acquisition and I couldn’t be happier.","IT security professionals are risk-adverse by nature so selling IT transformation can be tricky. Sales need to quickly identify and partner with the progressive individual/s in the organization looking to implement change rather than spend time with those who feel threatened that their job deploying security patches is going away.

This architecture has enabled Zscaler to capture more of the market as companies shift their apps to the cloud and want to move their security services between wherever the users are and the resources they are trying to access. Management believes deeply in the mission and is focused and driven with a high bar for entry and high expectations after you join. For me, this is a positive.

Leadership is extremely poor and the CEO cannot seem to get out of his own way to allow people to do their job, not to mention trust anyone to create success. Everything is slow to happen here and budget approvals are nearly impossible to get because everything comes down to penny pinching. Pay is low and Zscaler's intention is to low ball everyone as much as possible and deny raises when they are deserved. They also like to hire someone to do one job function or manage one territory then pile on more once they are hired. That person must ""prove themselves"" until the next evaluation period to secure the title or raise they deserved that previous year. They cannot keep good talent and have seen extremely high turnover.

Customers complain of complicated deployments, outtages too often. As a Cloud-only company the top priority should be stability and UX. Sales seems to be a dizzying revolving door, mostly from reps leaving vs being let go. Most companies are intrigued with the solution, but when it comes time to purchase, most find it too risky to move away from existing solution, or deem it a low priority project.

Mon Jan 09 2017 12:51:49 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Inside Sales Representative,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Reported for fake reviews - here's the truth,I worked at Zscaler full-time for more than a year,"For customers that are able to get it deployed without a ton of issues, the product itself is very solid and robust. When going through a demo with a customer showing what the solution is capable of, I frequently hear things like “wow!” and “that is awesome!” Though difficult to deploy (much more on that below) the technology behind Zscaler and the capabilities of the solution is most impressive.","Customer support is terrible, especially during the initial deployment phase, and returns are through the roof high. When you close a sale, you then have to hand hold the customer and support through the entire deployment process to keep things in line, and then escalate, escalate, and escalate some more when things get out of hand, which happens on almost every deal (not exaggerating). Many (though far from all) of our deployment technicians are technically capable, but are very difficult to understand, have terrible communication & customer support skills, take forever to respond to inquiries, etc. I’ve had multiple customers commenting on their deployment experience saying things like “the entire thing has been a sad comedy of errors” and “it’s getting silly, to put it nicely”. The return rate is the highest I’ve ever seen at a company. After you close a sale you’re then sitting on pins and needles hoping it doesn’t come back. This isn’t so much a knock on our deployment team as it is a commentary on the refusal of leadership (specifically Jay) to adequately staff and train the reps. Multiple requests have been made that would help resolve this issue which Jay has shot down. As if the massive returns were not enough, even if everything we sold stayed sold, the team would still be well below 50% of their number due to a combination of a refusal to invest in marketing and an insistence on setting wildly outlandish quotas. Executive leadership expressed to Jay, with data supporting their case, what quotas should set at. Jay stubbornly refused and insisted on quotas that were more than double what was proposed. On a team of more than a dozen tenured seasoned sales professionals, not one made it even halfway to the number this past fiscal year. (Again, not exaggerating.) These returns have had a very negative impact on our relationship with channel partners. Word has gotten around at CDW & SHI not to waste time selling Zscaler as there’s a good chance it’ll be returned and you’ll have a customer satisfaction issue on your hands. There are some things going on at a high level to grow these partnerships, but at the ground level where the rubber hits the road, it’s ugly. Another true story regarding returns: It has happened more than once where a rep would close a deal, then leave Zscaler or move to another role, and then when the deal got returned, the rep that was then covering the territory when the return came took a hit. They never got paid for the initial sale, yet got dinged when the return came. That is not right, yet it has happened more than once. Add this to the list of other shady & unethical things others have reported in their reviews. If you happen to work in sales for Zscaler, be very sure to keep track of what you earn and triple check your paychecks. More than once a reps commission check was wrong. We would have to call out the error, fight to get it corrected, then they acted like everything was fine all along. One shining light in all the deployment issues was the director of deployment, who was phenomenal to work with and did the best he could with what little funding and resources he was allotted. He recently left the company, and I can’t say I blame him. At least when things went south with a deployment, which they often did, we could count on him. Not any more. He’s far from the first director/executive to leave. The turnover rate at the executive level is unbelievably high. The CFO that was supposed to help the company go public recently left. Several area directors have left. There’s been a high turnover rate with SE managers, CMOs, VP of sales, VP of sales ops, etc. So many executives leaving is clearly a telling sign. Why are they leaving? The word from many of them has been that Jay is an extremely difficult CEO to work for. He micromanages everything, sets ridiculous expectations, does not empower you to do what you need to do to be successful and meet said expectations, and is stubborn and arrogant beyond belief. It’s funny - the “Z” in “Zscaler” stands for “Zenith”. We’re the “zenith of scalability” and when it comes to web security, we offer a level of scalability that others don’t and can’t. It’s amazing how Jay can understand the importance of scalability in that sense and yet not understand how his micromanagement style is preventing his company from scaling the way it should. This mass exodus of executive leadership is not a new thing. Though I believe the recent/current round is likely the worst the company has seen, it has been the modus operandi to have a major shake-up every couple years. As some have put it “At Zscaler I’m never at a startup - I’m always at a re-startup.” Jay burns through one round of leaders and then rather than learn anything just replaces them with another set until he burns through them the same way. I’ve noticed a trend here on Glassdoor where after an honest detailed negative review is given, a very generic positive review quickly follows. It seems that something dishonest is going on here to prevent future candidates from seeing the truth about the organization they are considering joining. For example, sort the reviews by date and notice how two detailed reviews titled “""This a promising company with significant problems on multiple levels"" and “""Difficult place to work"" were quickly followed by the very generic ""Proud to Be at Zscaler"" and ""Happy at Zscaler"". If that’s not enough, notice the reviews on December 14, 2016. Roughly a dozen five-star reviews on the same day?!?!? Clearly dishonestly and unethically gaming the system, and reported to Glassdoor for such. As an interesting aside, whoever it was on the Austin team that wrote “""Proud to Be at Zscaler"" is either no longer around or on their way out as they are shutting the Austin office down per Jay’s refusal to invest in mid-market. The aforementioned former CFO told him that he wants this thing to take off and go public, he has got to invest in mid-market. The former CTO he hired from GE said on a webcast in front of the whole company that mid-market was the biggest area of opportunity for growth. Many other leaders in the organization, and throughout the industry, have stated the same thing. Their response? Refuse to invest in mid-market and kick that team to the curb. If you click on “rating trends” above, you’ll notice things peaked around May/June of 2015 and have been on a steady decline ever since. This can be attributed to several things, but here’s what I see as driving the rating trends: Leading up to and including the May/June 2015 timeframe, there was a lot of excitement. A new global VP of sales had recently joined. A new CFO that was going to help us go public. A solid CMO that was literally smashing our appliance based competition. A phenomenal sales director was building out the mid-market team to help the company get a steady stream of smaller deals to get to the predictable/repeatable/sustainable place shareholders want to see. There was a feeling throughout the organization like “this rocket is about to really take off!” Then everyone gradually started seeing that it was all for naught as Jay stubbornly refused to take any advice from the new leaders he had hired and would not enable them to do what he hired them to do. It was all downhill from there. When it comes to tech companies, Zscaler will go down as one of the greatest blown opportunities by a founder/CEO in history - an exact “what should’ve been but never was” scenario. He literally had everything he needed to fulfill the vision and then some. All he had to do was get out of the way. The right product, at the right place, at the right time, with the wrong leader. The blockbuster IPO that was touted for so long was not a pipe dream or empty words. It truly could’ve and should’ve been that way. What I have expressed in this review is far from my own isolated opinion. Most everything I’ve said is right in line with the general consensus of many if not most Zscaler employees. Anyone who paints a different picture is most likely either being deceptive or is still drinking the kool aid. Don’t buy it. Everything I’ve said here has been said internally a thousand times.","1.0

Even with a great technology, the company gets in its own way in terms of executing well to capture market demand.

Tue Apr 12 2016 06:30:05 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Sales,,Current Employee ,This a promising company with significant problems on multiple levels,I have been working at Zscaler full-time for more than 3 years,"- Without a doubt, Zscaler's core technology is superior to nearly everyone we're competing against, particularly when you compare the Zscaler Cloud against more traditional appliance-based solutions. If my review were based on the tech alone, it would easily be 4+ stars - Product Management and Development team is really responsive, both to internal suggestions and to customer feature requests. Numerous significant feature enhancements have grown rapidly from feedback from real customers, which is awesome to see at a company growing this quickly - Internal communication from product management / product development teams is typically really good - those groups are staffed by really strong engineers who are doing fantastic work on a rapid refresh-cycle - Product pipeline is very strong, with service enhancements and new SKU's coming at a steady clip, and all in response to actual customer demand - Partnerships with resellers like CDW, SHI, etc. are growing rapidly - New Headquarters building is great, and a significant improvement over the old location","- The entire Sales organization is imploding, and senior management are apparently unwilling or unable to do anything about it. Quality people are leaving at a steady pace and either being replaced by lower-level talent or (in many cases) not replaced at all - Overall communications from upper management tends to be awful. Sales org employees *never* know where things stand, and typically have to turn to the rumor mill to get a sense of what's going on. Zscaler has a serious cultural problem with poor internal communications (other than from engineering / PM teams as noted above), leading to seriously poor morale and high staff turnover - Current Sales Org leadership has adopted a severely antagonistic stance toward their employees, announcing brutal changes that severely reduce the potential earnings of commissioned salespeople, and concluding the announcements with, ""...and if you don't like these changes, you know where the door is, please show yourselves out."" - Sales management have repeatedly set sales quotas wildly out of sync with pipeline, resulting in sales teams missing their quarterly quotas by 50, 60, even 70%, with no quota relief. All concerns about quotas are treated as a personal failing of the employee, rather than a systemic failure of management - Marketing efforts have been highly ineffective. Executive team took nearly a year to hire a new Chief Marketing Officer after the previous person left - Exiting managers after share the same advice with trusted subordinates: ""avoid taking any sort of middle-management role at Zscaler - you will be micromanaged to death from the CEO down, given no room to grow or develop your team, and then pushed out for failing to hit wildly unrealistic goals"" - Stock options are extremely skimpy - if you are granted any stock when you are hired, you'll never see another share however long you stay - ""Benefits package"" is painfully bare-bones - if you're hired here, expect significant and recurring out-of-pocket medical expenses, no retirement funds matching whatsoever, etc. I've seen fast food jobs with cushier benefit packages - HR team is highly ineffective. Expect no support, encouragement or guidance from them - Many of the ""5 star"" reviews you'll read here on GlassDoor are specifically requested by Zscaler management, and many of them incorporate specifically-selected language from internal-only training presentations and videos. Zscaler management are very aware of their coveted ""Unicorn"" status and actively encourage employees to leave glowing reviews. I don't care *who* you work for - if you can't think of a single specific ""con"" to share about your complex and struggling late-stage startup, your review is worthless - Look through the history of Zscaler reviews posted here, and you'll notice several which prompted responses from Zscaler executives. Example: note that the criticism that one reviewer shared of the Sales organization was met with assurances by a high-ranking officer that states, ""... our VP of North American sales is a superstar and has been at the firm since the beginning of 2014. We are bringing large numbers of great new salespeople into the company - and we expect to keep them for the long haul."" In the time since that reply by the executive was posted, the person he was referring to was fired (or was pushed out), the executive who posted that reply was fired (or was pushed out), and numerous other salespeople and middle-managers were fired or quit. Not exactly reassuring","2.0

It's a late stage pre-ipo company with the typical pros and cons that go along with that. If you like that type of environment you'll love it here. Know that it's not a like a Google or Facebook that spend enormous amounts of money on free everything everywhere. But it's also not an uncaring environment that takes advantage of its employees. I'd say its a good balance that is run smartly. Yes there is free food, snacks and drinks. They bring in lunch for everyone on Thursdays and celebrate milestones with happy hour type celebrations. But that's not what makes it 4 stars - What makes it cool is people actually stay and hang out together. They don't just grab food and go back to their desk. You can see that people are friends and like to spend time with each other. The network security market is the place to be and the cloud approach is clearly ahead of the game. There is no question that in 5 to 10 years' time cloud based security will be the primary approach to network security. It's a good feeling to be at a company with products that are ahead of the game.","Again, its the typical late stage pre-ipo stuff like lack of tools or people to get things done as quickly as you'd like. If you are used to that you know how to deal with it. Core benefits are competitive but having some of the fringe stuff would push the rating higher - more generous time off policy, lower out of pocket expenses, education reimbursement, etc. I suspect more will come as the company grows.","4.0

Upper management communicates unreliably and the rumor mill is often weeks or months ahead of any significant announcements. - Poor compensation package - no 401k matching, cheapest healthcare plan available (expect to significantly pay out of pocket).

They have been saying IPO since 2013. Look up the Bloomberg article with Ceo on that. Hiring so many sales people but shrinking territories. Direct sales are not happening. Marketing is terrible. PM team is failrly weak. Total unfocused path. These guys bought Gartner and Forrester (and flat out lied at times to them). Stock options are an illusion. Look up what CEO has done in the past with his older companies. Best COO Lane Bess left - why is that if they are going IPO soon?! And ask about the 'board' . CEO and his family control most of the shares. Bess left and has a seat. So no really oversight. The CMO worked at a company that got shutdown and he got booted from Google. Otherwise no security experience there. CFO claim to fame was raising money in her last company. Hmmm I wonder what she is being tasked to here? Ops team and custome support are pretty bad. They fired so many people - they just 'disappear' like they were in old school Russia! And titular micro management culture . Oh and unless you are hot and under 30 don't bother working in marketing. ider sales instead.,"2.0

The most important thing for me, when choosing a company to work at is work/life balance and culture. Even the biggest salary won't make me move to a company where culture is horrible, and people miserable. Zscaler has met my ""human"" expectations: - Here is one thing that surprised me when I joined Zscaler: Everyone is in a cube, even upper management. No privileges based on title, no casts. It makes the place more relax and upper management easy to approach. - I consider myself very lucky to be able to work with very bright people like our CEO or our COO, who have accomplished grand projects throughout their career. I learn a lot from them. If it was in a bigger company, I would just have been a number and the CEO would not have even know who I am. - By working at Zscaler, you can really make a difference. I know that my hard work is recognized and there won't be anyone who will try to take credit for my job. - It is a fast paced environment, as you can expect in Start-ups. You can't hide behind your desk, like in bigger groups and get away with not doing your work. It's either you like this kind of challenges or not. I am getting better at what I do and capitalizing for a bright career. - Very good and smart people work at Zscaler. There is a positive attitude. We have lots of informal fun events like wine tastings and baking contests or outside drinks. Co workers are friendly, there is less politics than in any other company I worked at. - We can tell of good environment to work by very little details. Here is one: Like in any companies in the Bay Area, our kitchen is full of snacks and sodas, that employees can take for free. I am not a big fan of sodas and prefer sparkling water. I shared this with the person in charge of supplying beverages and the day after we got sparkling water for everyone to enjoy in the company. I know it's anecdotal, but to me, it tells that people care. - Company has a lot of potential, product is innovative and technology is disruptive. I have no doubt that Zscaler will do very well.","The company start-up mentality. It can be good or it can be bad, based on how you look at it. - You can work at a big organization and get away by doing minimal work. This is not the case at Zscaler, your work is very visible.

Free catered lunch every Thursday and plenty of drinks and snacks.","CEO Jay Chaudhry has a reputation for frugality, but has the best interests of the company at heart and is willing to invest in justified expenses. Like any large or growing organization, strategic initiatives can quickly rise and fall, depending on any number of extenuating circumstances, which can give the illusion of chaos, but at the highest level that strategy is well-defined and well-executed.","5.0

You will find an organization with: * Very smart & incredibly hardworking people * Amazing Product & Innovation * Atmosphere of dedication * Very approachable upper management (CEO) * Place to be if you are straightforward, self-motivated & love technology * Your ping-pong skills will improve Unlike larger companies where a lot of people end up taking credit for your hard work, Zscaler is very meritocratic. The CEO and Management are very clued-in on who's doing what and it is easy to shine here if you do good work. You will work with a very smart and driven group of people who share a common passion in making cloud security a reality. There is more emphasis on communication (monthly-all hands) and Thursday lunches are catered in to meet with folks.","When you are the first one in the space, the burden falls on you to validate all aspects of the technology and make it work. The team here continues to work through these challenges and you will need a optimistic can-do attitude to succeed here. If you are used to having efficient processes and procedures and a very structured approach to work, you may find yourself at sea. However, on the bright side, you can define these procedures. Likewise, do not let things fester and feel free to scream out to your manager as people here are very busy and may not have time for the mollycoddling and regular 1:1 available in larger companies.","5.0

Its products are industry leading and perfectly meet the challenges companies of all sizes are currently facing. The addressable market is huge and growing. Security is a must buy, not a nice to have and there is no better place to be than the number 1 ranked Security company. The third leg of the stool was our ability to sell the product and differentiate against the cheaper or legacy players who competed on price or their ability to bundle within an ELA. With a new Sales leadership team in place , this has been addressed head on and the sales team is becoming word class. The company is also changing rapidly. There are so many new roles being created as we rapidly grow meaning there are plenty of opportunities for career progression. Overall, this feels like a great place to learn and develop, the product is great and the future holds a number of exciting developments. It is still early days for my Zscaler ride but the signs are positive and I am expecting great things from the company in the future.","with rapid change comes a number of challenges. We still need for some systems and processes to catch up with the new reality of Zscaler. This will take some time. The expectations have also never been higher. If you do not want to work in a high performing sales culture that demands a lot from its employees, this may not be the place for you.","5.0

Yes, there has been a lot of change in the last 6 months and there has been a lot of churn, but everyone now is very clear on why change was needed and understands what we have to do. For me personally, learning and starting to practice MEDDIC has been a game changer. I have recently been promoted into my role. I hadn’t been seeking promotion, but was offered the role based partly on my success at Zscaler. When I reflected on whether I wanted the role, I saw it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, given the coaching I can leverage from the new leadership. We hire smart, hungry, ambitious people. You can tell this as soon as you walk in the office. There is a real buzz. Working with people like this creates a great working atmosphere.","Right now, I can’t think of any.","5.0

There has been a lot of organisational change, which was initially unsettling. However, the dust has settled now and we're already a different animal. We've always educated the market well and had a unique and defensible value proposition. Now we've added a world class sales process that helps customers realise the full value of what we offer whilst mitigating our own business risk. The coaching going on inside the sales organisation is of a very, very high standard. If you want to be the best sales professional you can be, then coming to Zscaler is a step in the right direction. The new recruits have injected even more energy into what was already a motivated team. They've come here with the knowledge that there is limitless support and patience for those who commit to what we're trying to achieve. The execution and character shown in recent months is unlike anything I've seen before and we're already seeing the output of that.",My original downsides with Zscaler have gone. The professional coaching was much needed. The new Enablement team and sales process has been a reinvigorating addition to the sales org. That was the obvious gap that's now been plugged.,"5.0

Mon Feb 10 2020 06:22:01 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Regional Sales Manager,"London, England",Current Employee ,A place to grow and become the best professional you can be,I have been working at Zscaler full-time for more than 3 years,"I wanted to challenge some of the recent poor reviews posted by disgruntled ex-colleagues, despite most of them being friends of mine. Due to the hyper growth we're experiencing, changes are inevitable. Until recently, we had no global sales process or methodology to work towards. Quite remarkable when you consider the growth we've managed to attain. Our CEO went out to find the right people to take the business to the next stage of our development. This starts by finding the right CRO who can implement valuable change to continue our upwards trajectory. And we hired one of the best in the industry. Some of the changes include; introduction of value-based selling methodology, MEDDIC framework and rigorous Pipeline Generation initiatives. All of these have brought immediate improvements to how we go to market and the results we are seeing. The disillusionment from previous employees comes from a negative reaction to change. Reps are now expected to own pipeline generation, rather than rely on inbound/marketing. The MEDDIC framework highlights gaps in the sales cycle and holds reps accountable for steps missed. And the value-based sales methodology requires a new way of thinking and communicating our value without relying on personal relationships. If the previous sales team stayed in Zscaler and adopted the new practices, I have no doubt they would be more successful. But not everyone is willing to do what they need to, to be the best version of themselves. That's all what is being asked. The new KPIs mean that the previous average of less than 2 meetings per week per rep is unacceptable - which seems fair. And each rep needs to book a meeting to a new route of money per week - whether that be cross-sell/upsell/net new logo - with the amount of services and modules we have, this should be achievable. The leaders truly care about development and the promotion path within the company has greatly improved in recent months. If you're hungry for success, looking to be the best sales person you can be, make a load of money and have a load of fun - this is the place to be. (Did I mention, our value proposition is second to none?)",Uphill fight for salary review - may change with new leadership,"5.0

Over that time, we have gone from a fast-growing gun slinging start-up, to the rigors of a quarterly driven public company. With the shift to that new world order, companies need methodical and processes to succeed. The days of gut feel need to be replaced with analytics and proven workflows. What the new management have brought in is the rigor and predictability needed to maintain the aggressive ambitions of the company. We can’t look back at what got us to this point, we need to (like a good software company) innovate. This innovation is much like the evolution of life, from a child to an adult. While now being an adult, doesn’t mean you can’t have fun and celebrate success. In this transition I have seen a very positive step from a singular person winning, to the team celebrating victory! We have set a goal and with the new team in place we will not just meet our targets, but crush them. : • “No man left behind” mentality • Endless Growth both professional and personally • Working with the best and brightest • A product that just works and fans that love us! • Strong Management with a vision","All companies have warts, but the upside far outweighs those!","5.0

This is a review for the UK team.,I worked at Zscaler full-time for more than a year,Scalable product that does exactly what it says on the tin. Customers are mostly happy.,"I joined the UK team over a year ago as the original management team were excellent, but consequently they all left to be replaced ‘en masse’ by a team of relevantly inexperienced, arrogant, aggressive individuals whose management style is to belittle you instead of encouraging your personal growth. As far as I could gather they came in telling the CEO and Leadership team that they could drive revenue up exponentially and quickly. This hasn’t been the case and their methodology is to bully, humiliate and disregard experienced professionals, driving a culture of fear and intimidation. They have successfully ‘managed out*’excellent people, to replace them with cheaper malleable recruits, whom they can manipulate into their ways. *Managed out – with abusive behaviour, told pretty much you are useless, moved your earning accounts, and opportunities to the new ‘clone’ recruits. Please search on the most recent and UK negative reviews here for the absolute truth to verify my statement. They are reviews from colleagues. New recruits are very much encouraged to write reviews weeks after starting (with managers standing over them as they write them), as I was (but did not), so you find lovely glowing reviews. If you are considering a role at Zscaler, then do your due diligence, look on LinkedIn for recent departees and reach out to them for their honest opinions. Sadly not HR or the talent / recruiting team as their job is to cover the cracks. If you join under this management team, then it is likely that your accounts and deals will be moved at a whim, to ‘manipulate’ the numbers for HQ, the game is for sales and targeted folk not to earn money. Despite reassurances about work/life balances you are expected to work every evening and weekends, so say goodbye to your personal life! You will be expected to attend the office every Monday to make cold calls under supervision, even if you live in the Outer Hebrides!","1.0

This new management is arrogant, unfriendly, they have a massive superiority complex (that will be their undoing) have no willingness to learn the product and actively tell new recruits NOT to learn the product. They have brought with them a new sales process that is being indoctrinated into the staff in a disturbingly cult-like manner. An important point is, it doesn't matter whether you are dismissive or even only have reservations about the new sales process - you will not last in Zscaler. It is not hyperbolic to say, either you BELIEVE 100% in the new sales process completely or you are out. To be clear, this new asinine management isn't telling granny how to suck eggs, oh-no, they're telling chickens how to lay eggs. And the chickens aren't happy. If a chicken raises an objection, well, you can guess the rest... (Not many chickens would choose KFC as a career choice...) This has resulted in a mass exodus of existing staff via either resignations or dismissals or demotions. People who have only been with the company less than a year have been treated with appalling contempt and an almost inhuman lack of respect. Anyone thinking of joining should seriously think twice before doing so. New hires are pushed mercilessly and are actively forced to work unreasonable hours. HR / People of Culture are AWOL basically acting like the Ministery of Propaganda and Social Media Damage Limitation. #Zscaler-Life (Watch this post get buried) In the past 5 Years, moral at Zscaler has always been low, but in the past 4 months, it has plumbed new depths.

Tue Jun 04 2019 11:44:34 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Former Employee ,The Devil Is In The Details - A Sales Perspective on ZS,I worked at Zscaler full-time for less than a year,"You will work with some of the best and brightest technical minds and engineering talent in the industry. Almost all of them, while absurdly overworked, are always willing to lend a hand and be helpful if it means closing business. I did not work with a single technical resource during my time that left a bad taste in my mouth. The technology genuinely works as advertised, and many large companies are taking advantage of the Zscaler cloud today, and will continue to do so. There is plenty of positive coverage of ZS now that the company is public. There are use cases and case studies abound, and many extremely credible companies that are willing to be references. With large opportunities, there is an abundance of internal executive resources willing to help you close business, meet with prospects/customers, and bridge gaps needed for you to be successful.","While all of the above at a macro level rings true, like I said, the devil is in the details: The company is a logistical nightmare internally. Many are brought on under the guise of a scope of responsibility, and then immediately handed twice that in work/responsibilities. One would intuitively think that calls for additional headcount, but the hiring process is far too long and cumbersome, and because of that, critical roles (new or existing) are left unfilled for months at a time. Travel is still booked through a travel desk, even for upper management. You are not allowed to make any arrangements yourself without prior approval. Not the biggest deal in the world, but annoying nonetheless. Training is mediocre at best. Fairly unorganized, goes off topic quickly, and leaves much to be desired in terms of understanding what is needed to successful within the role. Now, before I get to this next point, I want to call out that many companies put out difficult KPI's to their sales reps, challenging quotas, etc. and sales reps tend to gripe about them regardless. That said, the KPI's and quotas at Zscaler are not just challenging, they are wildly outlandish. Unless you cover large or major accounts, there is virtually zero chance you will hit your quota. The overwhelming majority of reps here do not. When I say overwhelming majority, I mean >75%. I implore anyone interviewing for a sales role to ask the question: ""How many of your reps hit their quota last fiscal year?"" Knowing that, you can also deduce that whatever you're given as an OTE potential, you absolutely will not come close to it. Work-Life Balance? Ha. Non-existent. I can personally attest to know multiple people working 60-70 hours a week, and still sending/receiving e-mails on Saturdays & Sundays. I have personally witnessed these same people get verbally berated for lack of performance. Senior Management cares about one thing now: the share price. If your activity and sales do not demonstrably impact it in a major way, you are effectively ignored. While not the case for me, I know of others who had ""mentors"" appointed for them that were so busy and stressed trying to handle their own job, that newer hires were left to fend for themselves and figure things out on their own. Look at the average tenure of a ZS employee. Doesn't that seem alarming to you? It shouldn't shock you that I know of at least a handful of employees who are literally counting the days until their stock fully vests so they can leave. Overall, I can't say as though I regret my decision to join, or to leave. I learned plenty along the way, and also learned what red flags to look out for when considering a company. I can unequivocally say I have never been more stressed at a job than I have working this one. Working at ZS is fantastic for you if you have the patience, time, and dedication to put in an insane amount of hours, and can handle being constantly micro-managed. Is it rewarding? Yes, in some cases. If you land in the right patch, or close the right deal. Will you sacrifice more than you think getting there? Absolutely. While not always the case across the board, it's also not by coincidence that many who do well here are single and/or don't have kids. For the rest of you, my advice is to look elsewhere.","2.0

I have learned a lot from the product management team here in this regard. - Open communication policy: everyone is actively encouraged to reach out to any team for any queries and it works really well with just a little bit of process. - Very accessible and innovative management: I have only seen successful adoption of strategic processes since I joined and I have always been able to get a prompt response from management for my queries. - Passionately curious colleagues: last but not the least, never have I had the opportunity to work with teams that are so invariably eager to learn all the time.
