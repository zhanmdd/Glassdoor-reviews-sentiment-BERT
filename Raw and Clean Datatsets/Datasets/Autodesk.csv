Typical ""read my mind"" sort of criticism from that manager. - Manager seemed surprised that I posted a Confluence doc about the vertical whitespace rules that I and 2 team members agreed on. The project was many years old and no one had written down style rules. Manager said ""I thought all languages wanted zero whitespace"". I had no response to this, I was just flabbergasted. This is one of the most WTF statements I've ever heard from a manager. I told a colleague about it (someone with close to 20 years experience) and his response was one word: ""Run"". For an example of vertical whitespace in a modern js project: see packages/react/src/React.js in the React github repo (not allowed to link it here) - Team member told me ""your question was innapropriate"" after I told them that the condescending response I got to a question was innapropriate. When someone tells you you are being inappropriate you don't say ""no, u"", that's rude. This team has issues.","2.0

The pace is picking up, with the new CEO, but it is still a lifestyle company that allows flexibility for families or other life priorities. While it is a company where you can build a long-term career (and many people have, there's a lot of loyalty), there is also a serious issue with lack of diversity at the leadership levels. So, if you're a woman, or minority, you can expect to face many of the same hurdles in furthering your career as you would at other tech companies! There is, however, a lot of change happening in HR and a push for more inclusive hiring practices and management techniques with the promise of shifting this over time. The benefits are excellent.","Few women or minorities in leadership. Big enough to be beaurocratic, but small enough to find good opportunities to shine and make a difference.

In between, they're still having smaller scale layoffs that don't make the news. Regularly removing products (including valuable, robust products) from their portfolio. If you're recruited and hired to support a specific product or product's capability, there's no guarantee that the product will still be around six months from your hire date. This has the following results 1) Very angry customers 2) The experience and expertise you bring to the table is no longer needed. Even if you're flexible and a quick learning, there's a significant difference between 20 years of experience in a certain application that's suddenly no longer offered and 6 months experience in what's left. tantly chasing the leading edge du jour with no real strategic focus, resulting in the aforementioned  regarding restructuring and software retirement. By constantly shifting gears trying to chase the latest innovation, they paradoxically become less innovative. Vacation isn't great: 12 days per year, which never increases with seniority. If you add that to the sabbatical, the vacation days per year really aren't all that competitive with companies that offer three or especially four weeks per year with no sabbatical They won't tell you about this during the recruiting phase, but they often have a 1 week furlough around July 4 that requires you to use your vacation days or take unpaid time off during that time.

The BUILD Space is truly an amazing facility that full-time employees have access to.","Autodesk is in constant flux with layoffs and reorgs... Every December and February everyone in the company stresses out about getting laid off. If you are looking for long-term stability, Autodesk may not be the right fit. There is no long-term planning or strategy (even 1 year out). Everything seems to be ad-hoc and very disjointed. Tons of silos that everyone talks about, but nobody acts upon. The executive team has secret meetings and do not involve key stakeholders. LOTS of meetings (even meetings to discuss next meetings topics - yes that's right). Not a very good life/work balance due to the constant flux, last-minute projects, and deadlines. Managers pick favorites and are by no means transparent -- despite what they tell you.

We have exceptional senior leaders who are forward thinking, focused on customer satisfaction, care about diversity and inclusion, and are approachable, authentic individuals. They are driving a major company-wide culture change initiative by introducing values and ways we work together, then reinforcing these messages every chance they get. This is both inspiring and equipping us to succeed in the future. My colleagues are super smart yet humble, nice, and fun to work with. They care about our products and customers, and go the extra mile to make sure that our products are the best and our customers are beyond satisfied. We come together on work projects, celebrations, employee resource groups, and informally which makes the working environment comfortable yet stimulating. Our offices around the world are stylish and uniquely designed. Many of us work with colleagues based in other countries and despite time zone and cultural differences, we all feel like we're on the same team. Everyone here is ready and able to pitch in if someone needs help. My manager is fantastic and my teammates are the best, which makes coming to work a pleasure (and how many times can you say that?). We’re able to telecommute when it makes sense, but I’d rather be in the office because my teammates always enhance the work I’m doing. I love the projects I’m working on because they have a global impact that helps shape the future of the company, which inspires me to do my best work! For an ‘older’ tech company, Autodesk is purposefully encouraging a ‘start-up’ type environment where we act with courage and move quickly. With recent acquisitions and internal changes, we’re positioned to DOMINATE the industries we’re focusing on, which makes our future look pretty rosy. All of this makes Autodesk one of the most exciting places to be, so if you get a chance to join us, TAKE IT!",None that I'm aware of.,"5.0

I also have access to a wide variety of training resources, either digitally or in-person. I feel like when I am ready to make a move into the next step in my career, I have the resources I need to do that within Autodesk rather than moving to another company.","As a millennial in the San Rafael office, it's been a bit challenging to get to know people within my division and department. It would be great to have other types of events that are not so family-focused so I can meet more people in my age group.","4.0

The Denver office has a truly collaborative feel. People are just nice here, and that says a lot when we are talking about 200 people in this office. Located one block from Union Station, the office is really beautiful and we all have stand-up sit-down desks. Autodesk funds some nice employee-related activities, some that are fun but also those that give back to the community. Also, who offers a SIX WEEK paid sabbatical (after 4 years) - this is an amazing benefit! There's also a huge emphasis on employee referrals, and the payout is VERY generous.","I don't experience this personally but I hear there is a lack of promotion opportunities for employees in more junior positions. However if you want to make a move laterally and try something new, this is the place for you. The Denver office has a lot of other businesses in this location so it's a place to come and stay (it just made not include a salary increase).

Though I was always working towards promotion, earning excellent reviews during each review cycle, each reorg seemed to set me back to square one with a new boss. I was told multiple times that you need to perform at the position you hope to be promoted to for *years* before you’re recognized with a title change and pay raise. You can switch positions internally but even if the role is a higher pay grade, you can only be paid at the same grade the role you transitioned from. My last year at Autodesk my most current boss told me I’d be promoted by the end of the year, instead I was laid off during, yet another, company reorganization. Autodesk is a velvet coffin. Get comfortable in your role because you’re not going anywhere within the company, you’ll like it there so you won’t really try to leave. Your skills will become stale if you’re not developing them outside of Autodesk because this is not a company you can grow with. You’re just a stepping stone for them as the transition through multiple reorganizations.","2.0

There's an internal policy that current employees cannot apply for jobs at a higher grade-level than their current grade-this is a real policy confirmed verbally by HR. Mediocrity and ineptitude run rampant and are rewarded and direct communication and innovative thinking are penalized. People stay here so long (many 10-25 years), which contributes to complacency and fear of change. Promotions come to people based on time-served and age rather than meritocracy. No directors under the age of 40 and lack of diversity (of any kind) in leadership positions. Lack of diversity contributes to homogeneous group-think, fear of innovation and avoidance of new technology. Managers are more concerned with pleasing their managers than developing their staff and doing what's best for the company.

The almighty 'sabbatical' which is every four years six weeks off is the great benefit, but the vacation offered yearly is sub-par, so the sabbatical only compensates for this. If you make it to each four year mark without a layoff.

For a very large company that is full of very talented and intelligent individuals, you will be pleasantly surprised on how most are very helpful and less egoistic. I have an opportunity to work from home, but I always look forward coming to our office and take any opportunities I can, to meet colleagues in person. It seems to be in the DNA of Autodesk to be good to its people and it reflects on how most employees treat each other. Technology - what else can you ask for? Helping our customers MAKE things with a broad range of products in our portfolio. Seeing what customers created using our technology may it be a movie, buildings (I see many just within where I am), and even on kids school projects, make you proud to be a part of this organization. People - This time, I refer to our customers. Our customers are first and foremost the lifeblood of what we are now and what we continue to grow into. Customers who stood by us, work with us, and genuinely wants to see us succeed, is what keeps me motivated and enjoy being part of Autodesk. Oh, by the way, as mentioned by many - Work Life Balance is a big deal at Autodesk. It does not mean that you will not work long hours from time to time. But, when you do, you do not even realize it because you enjoy what you do but also, they make you take a break and they genuinely care that you prioritize your family before work. At least that was my experience.","It is a big company that is still transforming into its new business model and adjusting to what the market demands. There seems to be a lot of positioning to what is ""Hot"" and in the process, an opportunity to grow can become challenging. It seems that it ends up promoting unintended competition to be recognized and hopefully, an opportunity for moving up the ladder. The Grade level system means well, but, it seems that moving up internally is more challenging than someone being hired from outside. Someone who have been in the company a bit longer, knows the process, know the people, products, etc. can be in the same grade and pay level as a new hire. Similarly, if there is an opportunity for an internal job opening where you can meet about 80% of the requirements, but you are two grade levels below the req., you cannot apply for that role. Someone outside with unproven track record and maybe meet 90% of the requirements on paper - has a better chance of getting it. I have been in the company for 6 years and I have experienced re-structuring about 4 times. Some are company-wide and some on the organization level within. This is not uncommon for the industry that is changing rapidly. Do not get discouraged by this comment, it only means that you need always strive to learn something new and be prepared for change and find an opportunity when change happens.","4.0

I was fortunate to experience the four-year sabbatical, and it was life-changing. Also, being able to work from home or the office or anywhere and having the purse strings of a deep-pocketed company to purchase and experiment with tools or services I needed to do my work was extremely satisfying. I loved the autonomy that I had in my own personal work choices. Huge! The small team I worked with did amazing things together as marketers, piling up record subscription sales and organic traffic (but, it must be said: only because we resisted the go-along-get-along ways of our deep-state co-workers).","The company plays up its position as an innovator in design, but they are struggling with old code bases and an inability to tie together their software into packages that work for people on all devices. Despite how hard they try to convince themselves internally, this company is absolutely not user-focused. It’s full of engineers and middle managers who want a 9-5 job and no surprises; they simply don't strive for excellence. Most of the people I worked with had no experience building SaaS software (or any online services), a stubborn inability to think of users first, and they often struggled with the methodologies of agile software production. I worked with a lot of incompetent people at Autodesk who couldn't move past their old ways of making boxed software that they only had to update once per year. Promotions are very rare unless you are really good at corporate politics. This place is surprisingly boring considering its potential for making industry-changing software.","3.0

Alternative can be quite the opposite experience.","Lack of strong, respected executive level leaders and mentors: - Executive leadership team is largely inaccessible other than Town Hall sessions. - Executive leadership team is saturated with experience in Autodesk's historic business model and void of experience in Autodesk's new business models (SAAS, cloud, customer success, etc.). - Executive leadership team is out of touch with customers and their expectations as well as the internal Autodesk workforce. - Executive Sales leaders are ego driven, arrogant and have limited to no self-awareness of their roots. They routinely take input from a limited few in their inner circles and rarely demonstrate trust across their extended leadership teams. Annual restructuring events: - Annual restructuring events are highly distracting, morale killers and lack the needed transparency from the executive leadership levels. Messaging is perceived as disingenuous. - Middle management is left to deliver the difficult message to the masses without real clarity or proper pre-planning. - Poor timing prior to the holidays and in the midst of closing year end business. Opportunities to advance: - Advancement opportunities have the perception they are hand-picked for a chosen few and often filled before positions are opened. - Very limited opportunity to pursue adjacent roles unless you're located in San Francisco or a major office. If located elsewhere, no relocation assistance is offered. - Unless you're in San Francisco, Boston or one of the Hubs (Denver, Barcelona, etc.) you're extremely limited if not excluded altogether from any growth or consideration. - Little time is invested in developing and evolving a culture to coach, develop and build talent. There are development programs, but again, only available for a select chosen few.

A core of true believers still remains, people who care about customers, products and each other.","The true believers are being swallowed up by a crowd of opportunists who are focused only on seeking political favor from senior leadership. Many of these opportunists barely know who their customers are and what they want. A few years ago, Autodesk decided that it couldn't grow and compete by acquiring technology (it long ago gave up trying to innovate organically). Its new strategy, which has been increasingly visible over the past four years, has been to extract more money from customers who can't switch away easily from its products and to reduce costs by systematically cutting ""experienced"" employees, regardless of performance, and replacing them with interns and new hires. Of course, every company needs to turn over its skill base to stay relevant, but at Autodesk there is a pattern where low performing, highly paid but politically savvy employees are retained while higher performers are let go. What's worse, some of the new hires aren't always top performers (to be fair, some are excellent, but why settle for just some). The environment has become increasingly political, and a company that has always struggled to listen to customers has become practically deaf to them at this point. Oh, and the sabbatical seems like a cool idea, but when you compare it against a standard vacation policy it's not such a great deal.","2.0

There is full definition behind our corporate initiatives and leadership makes its a priority for you to completely understand ipthem. The second point is the team I’m apart of. You read in other companies reviews (I’m referring to the ones I’ve worked for of course) states, “everyone is so willing to help you” but I’ve experienced the opposite on quite a few occasions. Not here! People will absolutely drop what they’re doing, call you after hours and set aside as much time as you need to understand and then action to success. I’m very blessed to be a part of this organization! The pay is wonderful.

In my organization, our non-technical program management group has taken over. They are hell bent on implementing Agile SCRUM as the solution to all of our problems, real and perceived. It is a sign of a lack of trust in the engineering team to get something done. To make matters worse, it isn't fixing much of anything but we pretend like it is working because politics. I worry some of our agile champions will migrate to other parts of the company after proclaiming success, like a cancer slowly spreading until we have 40 hours of meetings every week. Morale is down and many solid engineers openly daydream about leaving. The former co-CEO was considered an engineering guy and left - or was forced out - when he lost the CEO race. Current CEO is a nice guy but he was promoted from Chief Marketing Officer, further proving who calls the real shots at Autodesk. Hint: it's not the engineers anymore. I can only give my perspective.

Wed Jul 12 2017 00:10:23 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), User Experience Designer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Great mission, but hard journey",I have been working at Autodesk full-time for more than a year,"- Company mission is super inspiring, and genuinely strives towards making the world a better place - Lot of awesome initiatives happening with biotech & research - Lot of work life balance - Lot of opportunities for volunteer work and extracirricular activities! - Super convenient location by BART - Lot of general facility perks, such as onsite gym and access to Pier 9 - I've lasercut a lot of stuff for side projects :) - Highly encourages making and you have access to the software for free - Company is pretty much the leader in a lot of the software we offer, so there's bragging rights :) - Lots of very smart, diverse, incredible people here! It's been incredibly humbling to work here.","This company is an old, old ship. A lot of the folks here have been here forever (10+ years) and are rooted in dated processes, unwilling to take feedback from new employees, until the new employees either quit or stay long enough to get absorbed in all those dated processes. As a younger employee, this can be intimidating - an older employee, who I introduced myself to in the kitchen one day, offhandedly told me that I probably wouldn't make it to the 4-year mark, as ""millenials are noncommittal"". As a designer, the work depends (understandably) on what team you're on- but being a part of a big company, you will be siloed, and a lot of the work won't be sexy visually. There's currently been a movement towards creating global UI guidelines but it's taken a very, very long time to develop and the team that is working on it hasn't permeated all of the design teams yet, it feels that any one team within the company doesn't have much reach across orgs. Generally not a huge design culture here - we host a lot of design events for the public, but internally, design thinking is still relatively new to non-designers and pushing that has been a challenge. The designers feel very disconnected, and there's often duplicate efforts happening and not a lot of communication. There have been efforts to bring us together; we have designer all-hands, but it feels that the original gusto has worn off. The company is very numbers and sales driven, and at times so ambitiously so that it costs our reputation with our customers; often I've felt the way we sell and bundle our products undermines our customer experience. Some teams do not value or put as much budget into research, or sometimes that research will be introduced too late in the pipeline for any significant design changes to be made before getting rushed into development. The people here are very transactional and often look for their own interests. When I was interviewing here, I emailed a designer on another team to ask about her interview process and her take on the culture- only to get back a reply that I should ""consider what I could offer her in return"" for her giving this information and that I should ""think about what I'm asking for before emailing her"" and that she was ""tired of getting emails asking for favors without any returns"". That should have been a red flag as this was very indicative of the silo culture here- asking for any help from any team that isn't yours will warrant a cold response, if any at all- and often to get any help you need to pull favors. Perhaps it's just the size of the company itself, but to me it's never felt very collaborative. The company is very frugal and when I was in the offer stage, my particular recruiter was very, very pushy about asking for my old salary and as a result, my offered salary was much lower than that of peers in my same role and level, even after negotiating up another 5k. I have some suspicions that there is a fairly large pay gap between women and POC because of the way they recruit. Also, your experience will vary widely depending on which department you are in. If you aren't in the department working on all of the software products, you don't get the same perks: we don't get any catered food, we don't have a winter holiday party, and we generally don't get invited to the celebrations the product departments host.","2.0

The purchased product becomes bloated, unsuccessful, and eventually dies within 3-5 years of purchase; people are fired. • Facilities people are horrible for the most part.

But a lot of teams in the marketing and software development would definitely work you easily 50 hours a week. The most scary part is the company advocate a culture of being supportive of their employees with their careers but you'd better keep your mouth shut doesn't matter what you are going through. HR would never champion YOU. This company has probably the worst politics going on in a tech industry. I can't describe exact details because it would be easy to identify who I am. But trust me, this is probably the last place you want to work for. Most good companies have turnover about 3-6 years or so. A lot of the senior managers in this company just get rotated around despite what their specialization is. This company does not respect specialization unless you are software engineer. Everyone else is supposed to be able to do anything and will be pushed to do so. By the end of my employment they are trying to find ways to tarnish my employment record but I wouldn't let that happen.

Autodesk is doing some very cool things in various industries and I believe they're moving in the right direction as a whole. The benefits are second-to-none and I think the compensation was very reasonable.,"The SDR role should be for a college graduate or someone with 1-2 years of experience. ADSK is unfortunately apprehensive to hire young people (without a referral) as it is a bit of an 'older' company/workforce. Therefore, they bring in people that have too much experience doing a call-center type job and get bored quickly. There is no upward mobility, pay raises, or varying responsibilities in the SDR role. They are limited by pay grade to actually move you anywhere so they give you the 'lateral movement' and 'create your own opportunities' speech. The problem with the lateral movement is that no one wants to put in 1.5-2 years as an SDR then move onto another product-line and be an SDR again. Also, they have made a culture of hiring from the outside so it's difficult to make a lateral movement anyway or create your own opportunity. During the hiring process, HR and a manager will say you can move into sales ops or marketing, etc. That is just not the case (until they bring those teams locally which is still never clear if they will). Low-level and mid-level managers were very weak. They, for one, have no time with their teams because they sit in meetings all day. So the aspect of coaching, mentoring, etc was hardly ever present. They also do not have the authority to make quick decisions which hampered the teams. Their was hardly help with career development like working on other projects, etc. Some people were able to do this, but for the most part your job is to just 'call' day-in and day-out. Also, as of right now, management expects the SDR to be a burnout role due to the huge gap required in pay and experience to move elsewhere in the company. They do not say that publicly, but no one seemed surprised when we had ~10 SDR's leave in under 2 months due to the fact that you can't move into an account executive role like typical SDR organizations offer.","2.0
