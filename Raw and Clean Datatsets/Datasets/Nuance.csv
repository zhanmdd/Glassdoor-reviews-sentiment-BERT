Thu Jan 16 2020 07:58:00 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Human Resources Director,"Burlington, MA",Current Employee ,The 'new' Nuance is an exciting place!,I have been working at Nuance full-time for more than 3 years,"Nuance has been through an exciting transition over the last few years and has come out stronger and better than ever. The new Senior Leadership are focused on executing against goals, winning in the market, and investing back into employees and culture. Nuance is unique because it is an industry leading company competing with the big names in the tech space, but still has some of the start up mentality where people can get involved in lots of projects and really create their own path. Hard to find a mix like that these days... Competitive compensation, super smart and talented employees, an exciting direction and strategy, and ability to get involved in anything you're interested in if you show initiative.","Some of the old-school learned behavior still lingering from the previous leadership team. It's getting better, but depending on what group or team you're in it can feel like things are changing more slowly. If you don't take initiative or network internally you might end up feeling a bit stuck. There are endless opportunities at Nuance, but with so many talented people you can't expect them to just fall in your lap without some initiative on your end.","5.0

I did work with some very fine transcriptionists and some of the team leaders were nice and sympathetic.","I have read through the reviews by other transcriptionist/editors and have been nodding my head for an hour. Yes, I experienced everything they did; their reviews are legit; I experienced this myself. Where do I begin? I was recruited for this job. I’ve been transcribing for over 30 years. This was the worst experience of my professional life. Right from the get-go, the recruiter represented the compensation was at more than $0.08/line, but that was a lie; he had said nothing about the “edited” work was compensated at half that. I worked here for about 15 months. It was awful. I was required to be available to work 40 hours a week; my shift began in the afternoon and I worked until 11 p.m. or something. However, there was never enough work to work more than 30 hours/week. I was scheduled to work, couldn’t work for anyone else, but for at least two hours a day, there was no work and no pay. I was still supposed to check in periodically to see if there was work, but this was uncompensated. I honestly couldn’t afford to live on $12K for a full-time job. At the time I was l living in poverty working for them, Nuance’s CEO Paul Ricci was reported to be the highest paid executive in Massachusetts, earning around $33 MILLION per year. There were frequent problems with the platform I was using. I found the IT folks pleasant, but the hours I waited for a callback for someone to remote access my computer and fix things were uncompensated time. I was repeatedly told “Nobody else has these problems” and it was suggested that I get a new computer. The computer I was working on was less than a year old, but I did go out and get a new computer, and the problems persisted. I supplied the computer, the Word software, the high-speed internet connection, the electricity; Nuance’s contribution to this overhead was ZERO. There were phone meetings and emails from managers where we were continually promised more work which never materialized. I worked on several accounts and each account had different editing/transcription standards. The QA was punitive. I was expected to contend with horrible sound quality (imagine 5 minutes of static) and produce a transcript with zero blanks or else my compensation rate for the entire pay period would be reduced. The entire system was designed so that transcriptionists were paid the lowest rate possible while keeping them constantly hungry for work. I came across an article on sick systems at issendai dot com and it really hit home. This is the Nuance business model. I remember bursting into tears and telling my supervisor of the moment (they changed frequently) that I had to borrow money for groceries. This was met with stony silence. By having us work at home (this was touted as a benefit) Nuance kept its transcriptionist/editors isolated; we couldn’t join forces or discuss working conditions and we couldn’t unionize or collectively bargain. Soon after I started, they announced with great fanfare and patting themselves on the back that everyone with Nuance NTS (the transcription end of Nuance) would be getting 40 WHOLE HOURS OF PTO PER YEAR. Cue the confetti. This was PTO that had to be used for sick leave, holidays, and vacation. The crappy health insurance plan had a $2600 yearly deductible. That’s right; on an annual salary of $12K/year, I was supposed to pay the first $2.6K out of pocket before the insurance would kick in the first dime. I have been on state medical assistance and it had better benefits. I was actually offered a promotion and higher rate to work as a member of some sort of special group of MTs that worked with new accounts, but my start date kept getting pushed back, which was disappointing; I kept hoping for more work and a tiny bit more money, but it was never going to come. (They can’t control you effectively by fulfilling their promises, can they?) I had applied for another job and asked my Nuance manager if I could use her as a work reference. She agreed and stipulated she’d use her personal email address. She mentioned that Nuance never answered any employment history inquiries. Under her breath, she suggested that I not give Nuance any notice of my impending departure. If I gave them a two-week notice, her superiors would have forced her to take me off the schedule. I heard later that Nuance fired all its California-based transcriptionists because that state instituted a higher minimum wage ($10/hour) and well, Nuance’s business model is based on exploiting an underpaid workforce. (I just noticed on Nuance’s website that they no longer hire in my state, either; our state minimum wage was increased to about $10/hour, too. I ESCAPED THIS HELLHOLE JUST IN TIME.) After I resigned (escaped), I was contacted about a class action lawsuit concerning uncompensated time. I didn’t join the lawsuit because I still felt traumatized over the company's abusive, dehumanizing treatment.

Only one person has been able to get a promotion (which turned into multiple) which was due to fraternizing with the director and not out of any talent or willingness to work. The rest of the staff has had promises made to them of varying levels of promotion opportunities and technical training made by managers to quell resentment over unfair promotions to the other team member but so far after 5 years not a single one has been fulfilled. There is zero career path for senior level engineers except the exit door. The 4 weeks of PTO is nice but no one in our department has ever been able to use it as our requests get denied.

Fri Sep 14 2018 17:41:16 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Medical Scribe,,Former Employee ,Extremely poor pay for the work required.,I worked at Nuance part-time for less than a year,"- work from home - employed position, not independently contracted - very communicative company - feels very connected even though nearly everyone is a remote worker The best thing I can say about this company is that they have got it together communication-wise. They have a good training staff and training program. There is a Facebook Work connection that brings coworkers together, and the CEO delivers weekly video reports.","- requires much more medical interpretation than transcription - it is not as flexible as advertised, as you have less than a full day to complete all your charts. - every team lead has different rules and expectations which do not match training This is not a transcription job. Transcription plays no role whatsoever. If it were, it would probably be much easier. Instead, you are listening to doctors' exams/notes and creating a medical record of each patient encounter. Although they will hire people who do not have a medical background, it is very difficult to figure out the context of the patient encounters in order to know how to fill out the chart accurately. I thought the training was great and very comprehensive on how to write charts. When I graduated training and was assigned a team, my supervisor basically demanded I throw the whole thing out the window and do it her way. I struggled with it since the company has standards and I did not want to break the standards to write my charts. Before long, I was transferred to a different team lead, who had a different set of expectations for filling out charts, which also were not in line with the company standards. Because I'm a perfectionist and because I don't have the medical knowledge to be able to translate the doctor-speak, I spent hours trying to figure out terms and decipher what the physicians were actually doing during the exams. I was frustrated A LOT. The pay is lower than any transcription job I've ever taken, and a lot more is involved in this role than listening and writing down what's said. Interpretation and translation are also of utmost importance, and the company does not pay fairly for the services they expect from their scribes.","2.0

Additionally, there's a huge part of the company that's outsourced (I notice that most of the positive reviews of Nuance come from offshore employees), which is used as an excuse to further drive down salaries. The pay is obscenely low. And I see people complaining that they got penalized for errors. I went a little slow and researched things. What I found was that a lot of errors still slipped through, but boy did I get penalized for not meeting line requirements.

I am blessed to have a terrific manager, though I am aware that for some Nuance employees this is not the case -- so this is also a pro for me, but not a given with Nuance employment.","1) Pay is horrible and remarkably less than what any transcriptionist is accustomed to making -- and unless you are able to achieve 99% accuracy, you will make even less than horrible reimbursement. For me average hourly is about $12.50/hour -- less if you make even 1 mistake that is considered as critical according to Nuance standards. Having 1 mistake made during 1 day of work affect your ENTIRE week's reimbursement level is the ABSOLUTE BIGGEST ""con"" in my opinion. I agree with checks and balances as well as being penalized for a critical mistake -- this serves as a deterrent and forces us all to be more cautious, careful and meticulous about our work, which is important --- but seriously reducing an entire week's salary is an extreme in my opinion. I know of no other workplace that penalizes its employees this harshly. 2) The amount of work seems to be a struggle fairly frequently. I have 1 primary account and 4 secondaries and still find myself OOW (out of work) often. You can't make money (even a little bit), if you have no work to do.

The only reason you and your MTs are being brought on is to keep the client calm, while Nuance dispatches the client's work to India or to an outside MTSO. At that point, neither you nor your team of MTs will be of any use to Nuance anymore and you all will be fired. The atmosphere at this company on the transcription side is absolutely toxic. It is an atmosphere of fear and stress, wondering who will be cut next. What this does is create an environment of distrust between all operation managers and an environment of desperation and suspicion. There is no sharing of ideas, no sharing of information, and absolutely no training of any new operations managers because then they would become a threat to someone with an existing job. But, this company will expect you to exhaust yourself, give 150%, work day and night over a whole summer to try and bring them back from a malware disaster of their own making, only to fire you once the dust settles. Do not ever kid yourself into thinking this is a company where you can grow, if you are not part of your (laughable) senior manager's ""in crowd"" you do not stand a chance.

Depending on division, employees are often encouraged to try new things, bring ideas, and have an ""it's OK to try and fail"" mentality, as long as it led to another idea/solution. There is flexibility in schedule, and the ability to work from home when needed. Nuance has partnerships with a lot of large customers, which provides opportunity to influence trends in technology beyond voice tech.","Re-orgs. There were frequent re-orgs and lay-offs for a period of time, which led to lowered morale, frequently shifting priorities, and unclear direction. There was little-to-no growth paths for internal employees, often hiring from outside or acquiring smaller companies instead. The technology is notch, the products are not. The products are driven mostly by marketing and sales, some product management, little design support. This stifles the growth and success of the products, as the focus isn't on usability, but hitting numbers.","3.0

I have witnessed them individually sue former employees of acquired companies to slow them down. I have seen them legally bring a leader in a niche market to a crawl for owning the space they want to be in but have nothing to offer.

I have also seen coworkers that I loved to work with become unbearable to work with in a managerial role due to extreme pressure from up top to produce, not take vacations (or make it using 1 day a week so you're in essence always working), and including holidays.

Many could excel tremendously both financially and achieve broadened application of skills elsewhere. Culture and values great at worker level.","Poor communication from upper management down. Rampant politics and in-fighting that clouds judgement and prevents the establishment of a clear strategic direction. Lack of accountability at higher management levels. Financial decisions regarding investments in technology refresh, advances and maintenance are puzzling. Seems to be toxicity in and between middle and upper management. Expectations set by upper management appear abusive towards workers in some cases, but is cleverly crafted to provide plausible deniability. Closer examination and analysis in the absence of fear is very enlightening. Decisions by upper management levels seldom consider the human elements when those decisions will impact workers -- comes across as a total disregard for the individual's time and is quite disrespectful. In some cases decisions stand in stark contrast to the work/life balance touted by management. Stock value is flat. Bonuses are awarded in stock and the stock value often tanks when options vest, yet have been taxed at higher value before vesting. Likely an unfortunate coincidence which works out in the wash, but value often does not match the original intended bonus percentage. Poorly, if at all, prepared for DR, Business Continuity, or Crisis Management. As a result the business is at substantial risk and this has been demonstrated recently during a malware/ransomware attack. BOD should be asking hard and serious questions as should investors with influence, regarding IT security practices, and who is accountable for the lack there of, and then take appropriate action up to an including dismissal. Questionable Information and IT Security Procedures, and/or lack thereof. Ask yourself this before considering joining Nuance. If an organization is hit by a virus/malware/ransomeware, such as Petya, a WannaCry variant, and the recommendation to patch with an update that was available and widely known of at least two months before the virus hit, who is accountable for leaving systems unprotected and vulnerable thus allowing a $2 Billion Dollar business to be taken to its knees in a matter of minutes? What about the lack of routine patching of user systems and servers within prod, dev and otherwise? Is it the CEO, CIO or CISO? It is not the individual contributors. The fact that a company would be hit by such an event is not a matter of bad luck that can be attributed to ""it could happen to anyone"". It is a matter of not being prepared -- all despite the international news, and the IT community in general, making the risks as well as the fix well known to the world well beforehand. The company is paying the price now and then some. Unfortunately customers have suffered as a result.","3.0

They claimed that I would work a full-time Monday through Friday shift, but there was never any work during that time. I was required to log on several times a day to check for work, but I was not paid for my time doing that. Then I would get rude e-mails every Friday stating that I had just better work over the weekend if I intended to get my lines in. I was told that 80% of my work would be straight transcription, but it was 99% editing, which of course pays only half. I was told that they would be responsive to any questions or concerns, but they were not. My supervisor would send me e-mails several times throughout the day and require immediate response, which really cut into any work I was able to get, but she never responded to any e-mails I sent her. We were required to do several tasks that were unpaid. The way they calculated errors and production was a joke. The pay was low, and people with 20 years of experience were paid no more than newbies. The last straw was when we were required to take a test, which I took and passed with 100% accuracy, but she apparently overlooked the results and locked me out of the system, then went on vacation for a week. I couldn't get any response from her or her supervisor, so I sent in my resignation with immediate effect. That was the first and only time anyone from Nuance bothered to contact me regarding my concerns. My supervisor's boss actually called me on the phone and asked me not to resign. I told her that the three months at that company were the worst work experience I had ever had in my life, and I moved on to another company.","1.0

Then the next round of layoffs - and you are placed on the chopping block because you simply priced yourself out of a job. The budget is handed down departmentally by Sr. Management - the department heads have no choice but to let go the highest paid - no matter how long it took to get to that salary, no matter how many hours over 40 hours were worked to get there, no matter how many opportunities were taken to advance their career and their department and their division. You think you've made it - you've spent your entire career working your tail off... but when you make it - and when you make the salary with it, you're first on the quarterly chopping block. After escaping that chopping block for years, I know how much those that were able to keep their jobs worked, additional hours, additional tasks... just to keep up.
