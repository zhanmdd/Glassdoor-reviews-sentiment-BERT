Wed Jul 15 2020 08:04:24 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Document Solutions Consultant,,Former Employee ,Great Co-Workers.... Bad Company,I worked at Reynolds and Reynolds full-time for more than a year,"There are only a select few pro's that I can give Reynolds and Reynolds. The first being the time that they devote to training. They spent countless hours on making sure you are prepared for the field. However, some of the training is irrelevant and seemed as though it was a bit dated. I can also say that the support team in Celina was incredible and they made the job a lot easier then it could be. That being said I feel as though they are undervalued by the company.","The list could go on and on but lets start with the “CEO”. If training would tell you anything, it would tell you that he is not liked in the industry. Its a bit sad that training managers need to teach you how to overcome that big obstacle, and they don't understand the half of it. Plus he doesn't seem to care much about anyone but himself and the systems team, which might I add is falling apart for Reynolds. Due to the lack of trust in the systems team, Reynolds customers are leaving the documents team as well. We spent countless hours building relationships just to have them broken due to the so called ""account manager."" I had a customer tell me ""I'm sorry, but we just don't trust the company anymore due to the shady games the systems rep and his boss are playing."" I won't keep going, but the last thing I will leave on the table is the fact that Reynolds overcharges for a lot of their products. Price was always a factor when it came to documents, and it is certainly a factor when it comes to systems. Reynolds is not the only player in the game anymore and the industry is waking up to that fact. It's time for some change.","2.0

Amazing culture, good salaries, excellent management, opportunities for advancement, wonderful coworkers, the list goes on and on. Basically, it was the kind of company you could see yourself working at for 30 years and retiring from - it was that wonderful. 

Fast forward, after Bob Brockman purchased the company, he fired or forced retirement of most, if not all of the the long term, most knowledgeable employees. He had every employee complete a Logic test, and if you didn't pass it (subjective), you were laid off or fired. VP's had every possible promotion reviewed through Bob (and/or one of his right hand men), even if they had no direct knowledge of the employee and their capabilities. To replace all the forced retired and fired employees, recent college grads were hired. For most of these new hires, this was their very first real job. They were thrown into the fray without any training and no mentors to help them. As you can image, customers had little to no customer service and issues were not solved. Add to that an archaic DMS system, and customers were not happy.

If you enjoy a company that treats their employees as if they were in the Marine corps, you don't mind being just another cod in the wheel, and you are a Yes Man/Woman then you'll love this company. However, if you appreciate the opposite of this type of company you should steer very clear from Reynolds.","1.0

There is good teamwork within the IT teams. The work is generally not too difficult. 6% 401K match is good. 2 years vesting period required. Company is run by a bible thumper of a marine.

If this means doing something because it costs more or takes more time because it is best, then they will do it. If this means they will screw over an employee, they will.

Individual office 2. Flexible work schedule 3. Easy work 4. Bi-annual raises(which isn't developer specific) There's a Christmas party that everyone enjoys because, well, they'd rather do that than give bonuses to employees if they aren't a supervisor or higher. Oh, breakfast burritos are awesome. Unfortunately, that's it.","The list of cons is too many to have in a numbered list. Although you're a developer, you do not collaborate nor is there any inclination to that changing through the standards that they have developed. Also, you won't be coding in the language you requested. The starting salary which varies depending on which recruiter you speak to and how good the CTO feels at the time($45k or $48k) is a joke to the industry average. With the raises, you'll see $60k in roughly 2.5 to 3 years depending on where you started. If you're promoted, there isn't a higher raise that comes with that: you'll receive the same raise as you would have as a normal developer but are then held responsible for a lot more. As a ""developer"", your work will consist of maintaining company standards. Meaning if your solution, which could be essentially more efficient, doesn't match their antiquated way of thinking, your code will not be approved and you will have to re-write it. Coupled with the fact that anyone who can write an if statement can complete a project, the job was stale and monotonous. You're held behind supervisors/managers who've been with the company 15+ years because, and this is a fact, they honestly wouldn't be able to do anything else if they tried. A director and SVP assumed that Java and JavaScript were the same. (If you haven't ran already, now might be the time.) The same goes for the rest of the company as I was told as their starting salaries are abysmal(~$28-32k depending on the department).

I learned a lot and voicing anything I was interested in learning gave me a lot of opportunities and projects. There are a lot of activities to be included in if that's important to you. There's always something you can be involved in or volunteer to do.,"I complain on the daily because it seems like trying to find solutions to any problem here is just overlooked. It was a red flag when I applied that design experience with Adobe programs were a plus. You basically have your hand held and are taught basics of every program. It's more data entry, copying/pasting and submitting requests to fix their terrible software than design. They're determined to do everything in-house and their software is always broken. It's pointless to make something look good if it's dysfunctional. It's monotonous and has no balance for life outside of work. The area is terrible too, so moving closer isn't worth it. Communication within departments and teams are barely there, so there's always work to be done, because you're having to fix things that other people messed up. Any issues that arise have to be done through supervisors because it would be unprofessional to tell someone anything. The raises are added to your salary but it's a joke on the amount. People have asked for raises and get laughed at because it's unheard of outside of the scheduled annual or bi-annual review periods. The company is a billion-dollar company and doesn't want to reward their employees as they should be. The jobs are underpaid (I get that it's a entry-level company and they promote within) and it takes almost a decade to get the same salary as other jobs in Houston requiring 1/10th of the experience. Corporate life isn't for everyone - some people are happy doing the same thing for 20 years because it's safe or comfortable. I was told to just get my experience and get out and I didn't get it until a year in. It makes more sense how dead end of a job this is. You'll never move up if management has been here for several years. They'll promote and won't give you a raise or promote and pay you poorly still. My motivation died a year in and I'm just here until I can get out.","2.0

Different teams are forced to work side by side for a variety of projects, but certain managers make working in a team environment unbearable. 

All employees are forced to log their specific work time and work type by the minute; anything less than 85% efficiency is a red flag, and you also have to have a high percentage (i.e. >90%) of your repaired units pass inspection or you can be fired. Really, though, everything is dependent on your management. If you have a stickler boss, you are expected to work in absolute silence (they'll move your workstation if you become friends with the employees near you), you're expected to exceed 100% efficiency (read: no bathroom breaks), you're not allowed to listen to music, you're not allowed to check your phone for the time, and any time that you spent away from your workstation (whether it's going to get parts or asking someone a question), is subject to inquiry.

They'll check your workstation for 'stolen' goods such as pencils, pens, and highlighters, because you're not allowed to have more than 1 of each, and you are told they'll check your pockets or purse if they think you're taking home anything. (Also, the pens are cheap and worthless, so I don't know why they're paranoid people will steal them.)

The only way to get in or out of different parts of the building is by using your keycard, and they'll track you with it. They're continually monitoring where you went and how long you were there. Stepped out in the hallway to go to the bathroom? Better hope you can make it there and back in under three minutes. Yep, three minutes.

They also get upset if you try to move to another unit. Switching around within the company shouldn't be such a big problem, but it is. Certain units have high turnover rates, and if you're there they won't let you leave. If you want to escape you'll just have to quit.

I'm pretty sure they are doing illegal things with breaks, because I'd have to work 6+ hours without a break, and even then it's unpaid. Some of the team leads are micromanagers who follow you around like hawks, and they'll badger you about taking a break if you do. If I wanted to eat, I'd have to find somewhere to hide and do it quickly, before I was caught.

There's basically no upward mobility or pay incentive for anyone to perform well. I had a 150%+ efficiency rate (since I was dehydrated and didn't stop to go to the bathroom and just worked nonstop while I was there), and I although I was given a 'gold star' during my monthly check-in, I wasn't offered even a penny an hour more. Even then, they still griped at me for daring to use the bathroom or go get water.

Honestly, I'd rather mow lawns than work here ever again.","1.0

They lured people in with Jr. Java Developer position, while their application is based on PHP. It's highly possible you won't have chance to really work on Java development. During the job interview all their questions were related to Java development, Java concept, Spring, Hibernate, etc., and it gave me the illusion that I will be working on Java project(I guess that's the illusion they intent to give me), actually I was assigned to PHP project and had no chance to work on Java at all. No explanation about this situation, I feel that I was deceived. 2. Extreme micromanagement. Poor management practices. They keep an eye on everything you do in the office. This is a small company, although the hiring process might be conducted by Reynolds and Reynolds, the management here has nothing to do with R & R. The management is very unprofessional and indecent. No guidance, no feedback even if you ask for. The time they give you review is the time they let you go. 3. Non-transparent. They have the ""elimination policy"" that they won't tell you even when you leave. They hire more people than they actually need, 6 developers for one batch and let 2 of them go without any reasonable and sufficient reason. I heard one developer with good Java skill were let go in a sudden. They keep their ""own people"". I wish I were told the policy and that they liquidate those not of their own ilk before I accept this offer. Nothing is transparent here. 4. Bad moral, uncomfortable atmosphere.

The pay for part time is decent and you gain a lot of great work experience. Pretty flexible schedules. I worked part-time while in school for almost 3 years before going full-time.,"The pay is absolutely terrible. $28K a year is not a sufficient enough income. The raises are a joke. The raises are distributed from a pool of money and not based on your hard work. Opportunity for raises is twice a year for the first 2 years and then it goes down to one raise a year. So, the longer you work there, the less chances you get for a raise. There is also a salary cap, so you can't make more than $35K unless you get promoted. Promotions are also impossible unless you kiss butt. The culture at Reynolds is not a great one. There's too much focus on the rules and policies rather than the happiness of the employees. Conversation that isn't work related is strictly prohibited. Phones can't be out unless it's an emergency. There's a high turnover rate. There is no appreciation for employees; we're all replaceable. You can work hard and produce great work, but you won't get acknowledged and appreciated because it's your job to do your best.","1.0

Only way to get promoted is to be tight friends with your boss and his boss. Saw way too many questionable promotions in my years there. It shows as quality sales people are leaving in droves.

Part-time pay is $11 an hour, which is not bad for a full-time college student. I have heard from former interns that their internship program is actually quite enriching (and great for finding jobs elsewhere).","- Management is incompetent. - Typically managers have been there for 15+ years, and there are almost no opportunities for moving up the ladder. - They historically underpay their employees. Buyers and software engineers typically make $50k and $70k a year starting out. Reynolds pays these two positions an average of $32k and $48k annually. These two positions requiring university degrees are just examples. If you apply for a position full-time and ask for anything more than what they pay, they will automatically decline your application. They won't even notify you of the pay they offer and give you a chance to accept that (likely because it is so low). - They have a high turnover rate due to their strict policies and underpayment. The average career life for an employee is two years. - Every policy screams, ""We cut corners and we're cheap."" They are nicotine-free (and test regularly) and only have diet products in vending machines to keep insurance costs down. There are no decorations or any investments into the aesthetics of the building; it's extremely bland. They rave about their on-site gym and cafeteria which is nothing more than motel-level quality. Did I mention how badly they underpay their employees? - You better not have nothing to do, because they will certainly find some menial task for you to complete just to keep you busy.

INSANE levels of micromanagement and tracking. (Had to have a serious conversation about frequency of bathroom trips due to the tracking of door access cards needed to gain entry to restroom areas) (Was asked why I leave at 5:00PM every day and not 5:15PM. Was told ""Management stays until 5:15PM"") 2. Nepotism was the rule and not the exception, with shameful levels of hypocrisy. 3. Pay was 25%-35% below industry standard across the board. If a Recruiter can look you in the eye and tell you that Reynolds offers competitive salaries, please make sure that they are speaking about your specific position. They are ""competitive"" only when compared to unemployment or entry level fast food positions. 4. Idiotic policies that are not explained and any legitimate questioning will land you in ""career limbo"" until you leave. (Best example is the fact that Reynolds use to pay an outside company, which was owned by a friend of upper management, to come in and polish the floors overnight. That doesn't sound too crazy right? Well the company was, literally, caught stealing red-handed and had to return monitors, cameras, hard drives, etc. Did Reynolds discontinue using the company? Negative, their solution was to pick a few random managers and supervisors to stay overnight to walk behind the workers while they cleaned. I also failed to mention that Reynolds has a full time janitorial crew and that the outside company had to use the Reynold's Janitorial equipment to clean the floor, as they did not have the proper equipment. My question: ""Why not just have the janitorial crew polish the floors, do away with paying an outside company that was caught stealing, and do away with having multiple salaried employees have to spend the night to watch out for thievery? I was told ""You go tell X that his friend's company lost a contract with Reynolds.)","2.0

They will continuously claim that salary isn’t the problem, but more times than not, it is. Job satisfaction is also an issue in the sense that you have monthly goals you have to hit.

Fri Aug 04 2017 15:50:44 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Manager,"Dayton, OH",Former Employee ,Do not recommend,I worked at Reynolds and Reynolds full-time for more than 5 years,"80% of the people are absolutely amazing. I have found some of my best life-long friends from the years at RR. The sales training and experience you gain by working here for a few years will be invaluable to a long-term sales career. The same goes for the problem solving and general staying-sane you have to practice daily while working here. The benefits are decent and probably close to industry standard (High deductible health, 6% 401K match, affordable vision/dental/life/AD&D). You truly do have the best products to sell in the industry...and although there is a lot to be improved upon...you can be confident knowing if you win a sale, it's because you deserved it, not because you were a sales monkey selling ""me too but cheaper"" like the competitors. Because of this level of skill required, you can make a LOT of money if you stick it out for the first few years (but you'll have to fight for a lot of it when they try to shaft you).","I have literally had multiple prospects/customers say things like ""call me when your owner is dead"", ""how does it feel working for Nazis?"", ""you're the only reason I tolerate your company"", etc etc. A majority of customers agree that RR offers the best products in the industry, but more and more they are becoming unwilling to pay for them, especially considering the general disgust most of them feel towards the company. Employees feel the same way, even those who have been around a long time. Team meetings generally consist of everyone catching up and complaining about how awful the company is, how they got railroaded by someone, or how the company owes them thousands of dollars they have been fighting for months to get paid. The ""leadership"" is questionable at best, and getting worse and worse. They would rather have incompetent and inconsistent managers (that they can control like puppets) than leaders who develop and unite their teams. I saw a lot of amazing employees get screwed and a lot of horrendous employees get rewarded during my time here. Much of it was, frankly, very sad to watch. Disgust is a word that described a lot of what I felt in the last year. There is an unbelievable amount of red tape and tension between departments. In what world is it normal to have to wait a week for contracts to be edited for a customer finally ready to sign a deal you worked on for 6 months? Many of us often talked about how it felt like management sat in a room to think of ways to make our already very difficult job harder. There is not a ton of opportunity for advancement. Even if there was a spot to open, you would likely make LESS money but have MORE responsibility, stress, and travel. I had many above me confirm this. There are many rumors going around about the stability of the company and whether or not it will be sold off in pieces. There has been a lot of reorganization going on the past few years and (surprise) it created even more turmoil and consisted of extreme favoritism towards some people.","2.0

Sun Feb 26 2017 17:21:18 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Dayton, OH",Former Employee ,It all depends on what you are looking for,I worked at Reynolds and Reynolds full-time for more than 3 years,"-Insurance is very cheap ($10/bi-weekly paycheck for myself and children) as long as you do not get sick. The insurance will cover wellness visits, immunizations, etc. at full cost but if you get sick or have routine medications it can get pricey as the deductible to hit is quite high. Since neither I nor my son got sick very often it was worth it, but for others...it just depends. You cannot smoke at Reynolds & Reynolds (more on the irony later) which drives down the cost. -401(k): Up to 6% match was FANTASTIC! I do not know of many companies that will match dollar for dollar to this extent anymore. When I began at Reynolds & Reynolds, they used Fidelity Investments (well known, reputable) for their retirement plan and had many options. By the time I left, they were using Empower Retirement (and had changed 1 other time in between) and the options were not as good nor as many. The mutual funds available are not bad but they were better when I started. If you work for Reynolds & Reynolds definitely take advantage of the matching option. -Workout facility onsite: The gym at Reynolds & Reynolds is just about as good as you would get at any pay-to-use facility. With an hour lunch break you can take aerobic classes, lift weights, utilize cardio equipment, or go outside and play basketball/volleyball/jog. There is nothing bad about this benefit. -Dining Facility: If you don't like to pack your lunch you can eat in the cafeteria. The food is pretty good for the price and the cost comes out of your check pre-tax and provides great networking opportunities. -Great place for young professionals to gain real-world experience. Reynolds & Reynolds will hire almost anyone with a college degree (more on this item later). If you have a bachelor's degree in truly any subject they can find a place for you. -Associates are really nice and easy to work with. The majority of the work-force at Reynolds & Reynolds are entry level (like almost any company). The people at this level in every department are wonderful to work with. In my time at Reynolds & Reynolds I witnessed very few situations of workplace tension between associates (associates-management different story...more later). If you work for Reynolds & Reynolds you will work with great coworkers who are probably also just starting out in their careers and you can make longtime friends and have a plethora of people to lean on for assistance/guidance. -Lower management does care. Reynolds & Reynolds is ""headquartered"" in Dayton but almost all of the senior management is in Houston. Of the 7 (yes, there are that many) levels between myself and the Chairman, only 2 were in Dayton. The lower management in my department was great. They were always willing to help out where they could and as long as you were willing to learn, they were willing to teach. They created a very warm, family-type environment in my department. Anytime there was a wedding, childbirth there would be a small celebration, and a thoughtful sympathy card for any loss of family. Reynolds & Reynolds would not be able to survive without these individuals. -Social functions are the best-around. Reynolds & Reynolds associates have the opportunity to participate in cornhole tournaments, softball/volleyball/soccer/card game/ bowling leagues, Battle of the Businesses (which they win almost every year). The Christmas party is great every year. There are too many social functions to list them all. If you are looking for something to do I can almost guarantee there is something going on at Reynolds each evening. If you are an aspiring alcoholic, Reynolds & Reynolds is the place for you. Every social function brings with it the opportunity to drink as much beer as you can consume (now or later...take some with you...no one checks IDs or inebriation levels before you drive off). There is always several large coolers filled with beer at every function (but don't you dare smoke). Overall, if you are looking for professional work experience Reynolds & Reynolds can provide that for you. They are well known in the Dayton-area and can add a boost to your professional resume.","-Great place for young professionals to gain real-world experience. Reynolds & Reynolds will hire almost anyone with a college degree (sound familiar?). In order to be hired at Reynolds & Reynolds you must pass a series of computer-based tests (math, logic, etc.). If you can score high enough you pretty much have the job, but the necessary score is quite high. While this ensures that everyone working at Reynolds & Reynolds has the potential for high-level aptitude, it does not guarantee 2 things: common sense or work ethic. Many of my coworkers came to work at Reynolds & Reynolds straight from their college graduation, often without so much as high school fast food experience. This too often created coworkers who did not know what work ethic is, creating a harder work environment for those who do, and leads to a high turnover rate among new associates. So if you are a prospective employee and have had significant work experience, Reynolds & Reynolds can use you. Just be prepared for who comes next, because they may be smart, but they'll likely be immature (both professionally and personally). -Pay Range: Reynolds & Reynolds relies on new associates as the backbone of the company, because they can be paid less. If you are a prospective employee, be aware...you will make less than the market average. If you have the fortune to move up significantly in the company you could make a good salary, but odds are good that you won't (more later). Reynolds & Reynolds has a series of internal ""certifications"" that are available to you as an opportunity to make more money. Each certification brings with it a $600/year salary increase and an additional $2,400/year if you pass 4 of them. However, you must score a 90 on the exam to pass, can only take it once per month, the material to study is vastly outdated, the questions are often misleading or worded poorly, and are never reviewed. At the time of my departure, only 1 person on my 20-person team had passed a single cert test. However, we received occasional e-mails from our VP reminding us that once we passed 4 we could afford a new car (more on him later). -Upward mobility is almost non-existent at Reynolds & Reynolds. As I alluded to earlier, there are 7 layers of management (but very few at each level, and almost all are in Houston). So since upper management almost never sees you in Dayton (more later) they won't know who you are, so you will likely not move up very high. For my 20 person team, there were 3 supervisors, and 1 manager. In order to move up to supervisor, a supervisor must leave or move up (most don't once they are promoted) and it must be within your current team (rarely are people promoted across departments...again...more later). It really is all about timing. If you happen to be the most senior on the team when a supervisor spot opens up, you have a high chance at promotion. However, if all the supervisors are only a year or 2 older than you, odds are good that they will not be leaving and you will not ever get a chance at a promotion. -Lateral mobility is almost non-existent as well. If during your time at Reynolds & Reynolds you work with people from other departments and determine that their department may be a better fit for you it is unlikely that you will be allowed to transfer. During my time at Reynolds & Reynolds, I requested a transfer to a specific different department 3 times. The department I wanted to transfer to was under a different VP than my current department so it had to go through the proper channels. Despite being signed off on each time by the requesting department, my VP blocked it each time. There was never an explanation given, not even a chance to discuss it (more on this VP later). So if you get hired on at Reynolds & Reynolds talk to anyone you know there first, because wherever you land, is going to be your permanent home. -Upper management (Houston) is out of touch with the regular associates. The best example I can give is about the VP of my department. In the 3.5 years I worked for Reynolds & Reynolds I spoke to the man 1 time, exactly 1 week before I left the company. I was in the restroom and he came up and asked me how my day was going (all while trying to relieve myself) and how long I had been with Reynolds & Reynolds. I responded that I was great since I put in my notice a week ago, but that I was glad that he knew who I was considering I had been denied a transfer by him 3 times and was a main factor in my departure. Upper management comes to town only 1 or 2 times a year, so they never really get to know what is going on at the Associate level. Yet, they create new plans and send the directives down to lower management to implement with no real firm implementation plan. This leaves the associates frustrated on how to do their jobs, and lower management stuck having to toe the company line and answer questions they don't know the answer to. The only time the Chairman (Bob) comes to town is the company birthday party, where he will tell the same story he did last year about how the tradition started with a barbecue picnic and someone told him to get up and say a few words (I think I have the story memorized after just 4 rounds of it). Bob will also regale you with his yearly stories of how the liberals are ruining the country, and how his $6 million in donations won the election for Donald Trump. -Redundancy for redundancy's sake reigns supreme. When completing any task at Reynolds & Reynolds, documentation is everything. So much so that it is required numerous times. You must first document within your department's software what you did, who you spoke to, and how you will follow-up. Then you must fill-out a checklist, initialing and dating each step that you completed, print it out, and file it appropriately for 6 months after completion for internal auditing purposes as a hardcopy (just in case). Following that you must then document on another software program how long that task took you to complete. 1 task=3 levels of documentation. -Alcohol consumption at social functions will one day lead to Reynolds & Reynolds getting sued. If you like to drink Reynolds & Reynolds is great. They will have as much alcohol as you can drink or take home with you at every single function. What is ironic is that at a company where you cannot smoke (they random drug-test monthly) or have non-diet soda, you can consume as much regular beer as you can guzzle down. There is no one who checks IDs (there are always interns at Reynolds & Reynolds under 21), or to make sure that people are sober enough to drive. I really hope nobody ever gets killed because a Reynolds & Reynolds employee had too much at a social function (and there are many who get their fill each time) and got in their car to drive home. -Diversity is a four-letter word at Reynolds & Reynolds. If you are not white, you are not welcome. In my 60 member department, there were 2 that were not white, and that's on par with all other departments. There are TVs throughout the buildings, but the only available viewing options are Fox News or a blank screen (this includes in the gym, because political news always gets me motivated to pump iron). If you have an alternative view point or ideology, you will keep it to yourself, or else be told this is not the best opportunity for you.","3.0

Inexpensive health care. Onsite cafeteria. Onsite gym. Onsite nurse practitioner. Excellent training.","Crap vacation plan. Little to no flexibility when you work at their headquarters, if you're in the field you can pretty much do as you please though. Poor culture, at least in sales, leads to a lot of turnover. They are constantly losing their top talent because of culture and my next point. Pay! Not only is their pay plan terrible it's one of the hardest things to understand. They want to pay inside sales reps as if they are full time fast food workers, their pay plan consists of one too many variables that aren't explained fully. Management. Too many times they promote someone who is just loyal to the company rather than someone who has the capacity to be a manager. They value loyalty but aren't loyal to their top performers. This again creates a toxic culture/environment. The cheap healthcare is not only a pro because of cost but it's also a con because it's a terrible high deductible plan. Reynolds forces their arbitrary agenda on you by limiting sugar consumption at work due to the beverages and food available to you but will support you drinking yourself stupid at company events, which is will probably lead to more diabetes then not having sugary drinks or food. Plus they have a no smoking policy, this didn't bother me but there were several people who would just take a vacation day if they got randomly selected for their test putting them back in the rotation but then allowing for them to continue their smoking. Not a progressive place. Very few women in power positions throughout the company. In sales they are zero female VPs. Very much an old boys club and if you're from Texas then you're probably just that more ahead. Technology. They are a technology company with crap technology that they force down their users throats.","2.0

Sat Jun 17 2017 11:34:15 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,Good Starter Company,I have been working at Reynolds and Reynolds full-time,"Reynolds sponsors several 5ks and sports leagues for employees. We have an Associate Foundation dedicated to collecting money and volunteering for charities. There is an annual cook-off/picnic in August that's very family friendly. They brought back the Christmas Party the last two years as well. There is a health center, gym, and cafeteria in the main Kettering facility. When we have mandatory after work business meeting/parties, they provide free food and alcohol that mostly makes the mandatory part worth it. I don't know if they are still doing them, but when I was a newer associate, I was invited to several networking lunched to meet more senior employees. The 401K match is very good, and you are fully vested after 2 years. Management will work with you if you need to adjust your regular schedule as long as you ask in advance and make up the time somehow (vacation time/extra hours another day). You can be pretty confident in your position as Reynolds is a strong company with a good outlook. It's a good starter company for new professionals to learn the corporate ropes. They have several educational classes offered for this purpose.","The company is very secretive, and the culture promotes a bit of a big brother vibe. Only management can work from home, and they are encouraged to monitor our badge in/out records regularly to make sure we aren't sneaking off early or arriving late. They track you wherever you are in the building. The parties are mandatory. This may be true of any company with a large sales force, but they are treated like the rock star babies. They are the most important department and must be coddled. The Contract Center was required to create a 2nd shift so that someone would be immediately available to help any salesperson until 8 pm. However, I should note, management really has your back (when possible) if it comes down to head-butting with the sales team, even when they try to go above you to complain. The cafeteria is very nice, but even if you pack your lunch you are required to eat there to ""take a break and socialize"" whether that's your idea of a break from work or not. The healthcare benefits are so-so. Vision and Dental are good but medical/prescription could be way better. Maternity leave has to be disguised as Short Term Disability. Sick days are split 2 any time and 6 doctor's note required. If yo do not use the 2 they roll over into next year as doctor's note required days. All of the above is nothing compared to Reynolds' biggest mistake in my book: when an employee hid cameras in the women's locker room, they did not notify the females who had been victims, and they fired him before notifying the police, allowing him time to move to Utah and therefore far enough away that he would not be extradited back to Ohio for prosecution.","3.0

Hard work is rewarded- albeit, not always on your schedule. The campus is second to none in the area and makes staying focused on your job easy. For being a large company, it is pretty flat hierarchy and your voice can be certainly be heard. Leadership is willing to invest in people and ideas, but you have to make a good business case as to why they should (as it should be). The biggest pro to working at R&R is the people. We hire great folks who make coming to work fun and not a chore. Also, the philanthropic side of the business makes a huge impact in the Miami Valley, so that is heartening to be a part of.","High expectations and big quotas can spook some people.

If browsing for fun stories here, not so much. Bottom line, if you are in search of meaningful work, decent pay (in today's market) and good benefits you will be happy. The company is the right company and you could raise a family on it (if working your way up). Reynolds has a good screening process in place, but some have called it too intrusive. Make sure that you apply for a job that you have researched and understand. Many unhappy stories can begin with not starting in this way. Can you picture yourself doing the job you are applying for? Have you spoken directly to someone in a similar role about the daily grind or advancement opportunities? If yes, that is a wonderful start to the application process. Get ready, you must be willing to apply and go through a process to land the job. Like you, Reynolds wants to know what this relationship will bring. The testing process is fair to everyone and is a good feature whether understood by applicants or not. Once hired, are you willing to work toward the goals that the owner(s) have in place? Are you okay with the idea that your real job is to do what the owner(s) have asked to be done in order to operate? In your interviews, ask ""what does the owner(s) of this company want to do as their main priority? If all this makes sense and you are a motivated individual with a track record of high working standards, you are a great candidate. The company has a system to identify your wonderful character. Be ready for hardball. This is a corporation with many levels of management with a clear vision. If you are not a good politician when it calls for it (can work with both sides of a story and derive an acceptable outcome), this could be a sticking point as you mature in the position. Good luck.","Pay scales are not consistent with output in a small number of instances. Just realize the closer you are to delivering hard-hitting results to paying customers in terms of your job type, the greater the chance of higher pay (in general). Otherwise, some roles are only starting positions, but nothing to sneeze at if you are starting out. Chances for advancement in many areas are minimal if considering the above paragraph. If you have skills and have a track record to point to, make it known. Reynolds will listen. Some have done this and have moved up quite rapidly. Others cannot wait and will move on (as would any other situation).","4.0

No Automotive dealership wants to actually do business with Reynolds so it is a constant uphill battle from the start. Despite a fairly decent product portfolio (still 5 years behind in most) the price is not anywhere near competitive in the market and there is very little OEM support. Once you get in, you soon feel trapped as the executives threaten people from leaving the company with their non-compete. They also do not allow automotive dealers to hire Reynolds employees. When the majority of folks on the inside constantly discuss wanting to leave - it shows how poor the morale really is. Executive team (gentlemen's club) only cares about making money with no cares for the employees or even their most loyal customers. The former president was the only positive image the company had. Uncapped commission..... if you have a good year, they reward you with a sales plan change so you never make that much money again. They track all employees by requiring them to check in using Gps technology Micro management Very little support from the inside. Expect 60+ hour work week for all the administrative BS you are required to do. Pay plans are not competitive.

There is definitely room for advancement if you work hard and take the time to build your skills. They have a lot of sports teams they organize for employees.","If you smoke, you will have to quit.

Great 401k match and favorable health benefit package (especially with the discount). The facilities are also really nice with an onsite gym, cafeteria, convenience store, credit union, and health center. I also think the company does a lot to try to provide training to associates knowing that many are right out of school and have zero corporate or automotive sector experience. There is room for growth though it can sometimes take longer than the 6-12 months that some people expect; you just have to continue to grow your skills and show your talents.","Sometimes Reynolds is at a disadvantage in regards to salary which causes some good people to go elsewhere, which is unfortunate.

I spent 4 years working for them and, in my tenure there, the department grew (from 35 at first to 70 when I left), but 54 people had left the department, some in a horizontal move to another department, but most just flat-out left the company. -It makes every job you have after it a whole lot sweeter by comparison. -There are opportunities for raises depending on your job and gender, but not large raises.","-By the time most people get to their first four months, they are already disenfranchised with the company and how they are treated. After you've been there about two years, management begins to single out employees and beat down their morale even more until they leave so they can hire someone new for less money. -Middle management is forced to take classes upon promotion on ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tsu as the guideline for dealing with subordinates. -They don't trust employees at all, and make it VERY evident. For example, middle management will watch your personal work computer's ""idle time"" clock in case you take more than 15 minutes for your break. -Reynolds found out that n employee was filming women in the bathrooms and locker rooms, but gave him two weeks to get out of the state before informing the police of his actions. Then Reynolds didn't cooperate with the police about handing over the recording materials and videos until the cops threatened to take it public. So, basically they're super classy there. -Also, if you're a woman working there, don't expect to EVER make it any higher than Manager-level. My husband and I both worked there, and even though we had the same starting pay and similar jobs, he made over $7,000 more than me at four years than I was making at four years.

We have a fitness center, a pretty good dining area, comfortable workspaces, and the design and atmosphere of the building is nice too. My internship experience might have been a bit unique, because I was usually treated like a full time worker. I attended the same trainings for regular associates that interns did not usually attend, but I also participated in all of the special intern lunches, classes, and team building events. There were also a few parties. Work isn't too hard, just takes time to learn. The days go by quick and we are usually kept busy enough to prevent me from being bored at all. There are intramurals and plenty of volunteer activities, in addition to other social opportunities.","Honestly my only real con is that it is low paying compared to most paid internships that I've seen. But some internships are unpaid, and this is a very valuable internship as it could lead to a full time position with the company. It would be hard to come up with any other cons, but while I do think the extensive training is important, some of the classes we had to take could be very long, and you'd much rather be doing work at your desk.","5.0

I've heard all the usual tropes about stepping stones, finding the right department, and oh yes, the PEOPLE. For the record, the people here are pretty great at least in the rank and file. The Dayton facilities are nice enough, food is fine but unnecessary, health benefits are decent if you don't actually use them...dental is good, and they do match 6% of your measly salary after two years vesting period...if you make it that is...","I was lied to from the beginning, plain and simple. They lure you in with promises of career opportunities and potential pay increases but none of it came to fruition for me despite long hours, high productivity, and even the agreement of my supervisor that I deserved more. In fact, I found out people with less academic, industry, and company experience were hired in after me for thousands of dollars more. Why? Because a sharp spike in turnover and an inability of leadership to trick new people into joining up (probably because of reviews like this) forced their hand on the whole base pay thing. Upon a few people discovering this fact, including myself, I requested a pay bump up to at least their level and was met with accusations of union behavior, threats of termination, and an official email to my whole team warning us against sharing salary information. What NLRA? I was blown away by the overreaction. Keep in mind, the value of my particular team's work absolutely warranted the higher pay and we all knew it. I doubt our team was alone on that one...simple fact Bob you may own the company but it don't make any money unless your super prescreened, high IQ, hard working employees perform the labor. My God this company...workers keep getting paid way less than market value while contributing a higher surplus value than their industry peers all while Bob keeps taking in the fruits of their labor for himself as cold hard cash and simultaneously buying new companies to diversify his portfolio against the inevitable downturn. So yeah, that's my contribution. Please read other reviews to get a more broad perspective before diving into this hell hole. Be advised, just skimming through some of these I see a huge number of suspect five star reviews. While I can't discount the possibility that someone might actually consider Reynolds a five star employer I'm going to go ahead and discount it anyway. Three stars maybe from a generous heart, more likely two from someone who has roughed it in retail, but a lot of those are probably fakes from managers/recruiters. I mean I remember they would sometimes try to solicit us for positive reviews during meetings but clearly their efforts exceed mere requests and move right into fabrication ugh what a sickening thought. As for the seemingly endless supply of interns who can definitely opine on that particular aspect of the Reynolds experience, I highly doubt they have any knowledge of what it is to actually work here for a living, yet just look at how many five star reviews from 2016 come from them...point of fact, the internships are great. The whole thing is a recruitment sales pitch as you would imagine, so they get treated much better than your lowly Reyslave.","1.0

Everyone I met truly loved their job, and they were all eager to help in any way they could. After hearing horror stories from my friends out of places they interned, I became just that much more fond of Reynolds. At least for their salespeople, Reynolds employees get treated very well. If working out of headquarters, there is a company gym, continual recreational sports leagues (which come with free beer each game), on site cafeteria, and a beautiful scenery. I am not sure how the other locations compare to headquarters, although from what I have heard, it is relatively similar. Outside of the people, the upper management is fantastic. I had the opportunity to meet many of the VPs and even the President as an intern. After meeting each of them, they would often greet me in the hall by my first name, and would be quick to start a conversation. Having an upper management that is willing to stop an intern walking down the halls just to carry on a conversation speaks volumes about the staff at Reynolds and Reynolds.

The company espouses healthy living (smokers are screened out during the interview process), conservative values, and a very team oriented - participatory style of work life balance (i.e. it's frowned upon if you don't make an effort to attend X-mas parties, volunteer work, or other office sponsored events). As far as job security is concerned, this company is one of three in the nation that services the automotive dealership industry. They've been established for decades as a provider of inventory management software and traditional paper forms used exclusively by the automotive dealership industry. Furthermore, the company has spent much of it's time making key acquisitions in other industries and services that support the automotive dealership, as well as branching out into separate software/hardware related ventures. Management has a long term strategy for establishing itself in a variety of industries that will always keep the company earning revenues in different economic climates. In that respect there's always a need to keep people working. Additionally, their 401K matching and short term vesting periods are very competitive. The company is also very good at providing free professional development classes for all employees (part-time and full-time) over a variety of areas -- free of cost.","Unfortunately, this company requires you to really adopt the culture and see this company as a place to build a lasting career. It isn't unusual to find employees working there for over two decades, and because of the company's small size (three U.S. locations in two states, and one overseas in Europe) there can be a waiting line for advancement. Furthermore, this company is a ""play-by-the-rules advocate"", meaning he employee handbook is your career guidebook. No bending the rules. In my case, after one year of working there I couldn't fit into the culture, and there were no opportunities that I could find for advancement or a change of duties. The job became a daily grind in a cubicle farm and I finally had to leave for something else. It's really one of those places where you're going to fit right in, or you're not -- period.

The dental plan is actually one of the best you can get. I had no wait period to have my root canal/crown covered. The facilities are fairly nice.

I chose not to believe it and now I'm trying to leave just 8 months in, instead of the 1-2 year goal I'd set. The only health plan is high deductible. If you get the discount (which is easy to get, you just have to pretend to the health center that you tried) it's really cheap but you still have to deal with the 2500 deductible before you get good coverage. They definitely underpay most of their employees. And they're constantly cycling through new recruits. It might just be my department but there is actually a distinct sexual harassment problem. Many people on my team and on other teams in my department find it completely OK to make overtly sexual jokes about me and sometimes including my boyfriend. Even recently my supervisor made a blatantly sexual joke about me and then explained the joke to me to make sure I got it.

I've met and worked with some pretty great people at this company. I have learned a lot about leadership and grown career-wise in my time here.,"Depending on the area you work in management may have your back or throw you under the bus. Lots of CYA going on in some areas. Also, the pay is below industry standard for most positions. Benefits could be better as well.","3.0

This is a great company to start out with and learn from. I worked for Reynolds in Houston for two years and I don't regret working from them. I had two tremendous supervisors and learned a lot about professionalism. Reynolds also offers continuing professional education courses, and the classes are fun, educational, and legitimately beneficial to improving skills from phone skills, business etiquette, multi-tasking, and more.","It's a tough environment to enjoy for millennials. It's a very strict and highly corporate environment, and it is a place you really want to be cookie cutter. At orientation I was deterred from wearing bright colors or patterns, you're highly encouraged to wear a full suit each day, you are very discouraged from having fun or colorful hair, you are not allowed to smoke (vapor, e-cig, cigar, cigarette, etc), and more. If you enjoy a corporate atmosphere, though, this place is for you.","3.0

Tue Aug 16 2016 09:45:21 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Dayton, OH"," in Dayton, OH",Technical Assistant Center Hardware Agent,I worked at Reynolds and Reynolds,"-Decent job to start a career if you don't mind working for a company that does not care for it's employees, treats them as expendable monkeys, micromanages and oversees constantly, does not appreciate or encourage individual achievement, does not provide raises and actively seeks to manage through marginalizing and degrading it's employee base. -Adult Mac and Cheese day in the food court. -Has full, albeit low cost, high deductible, benefits. -The company does encourage community, offering many group sports leagues, charitable events and company parties throughout. In the hardware position you will not be made to feel a part of any of this as you really made to associate or network outside of your group.","In case the above noted was not enough, the management team is highly unprofessional. You be acosted and held accountable for any and all mistakes you may make while documenting ticketing while simultaneously being asked to maintain low call times and implementing constantly changing yet never notified about policies. This will occur while management will spend most of their days hanging over you bantering about their sports rosters and their breakfast, yet will actively discourage any conversation among cubical neighbors. Additionally, the favorites game is played quite hard on this team. If you're a member of the select few then more opportunities come your way. It's not enough to be a hard worker who keeps their head down, you must also constantly stroke the egos of the man-babies who oversee you. Do not expect to get a raise on the frontline. This company is extremely cheap and refuses to offer competitive wages for Frontline or offer raises to even its best employees. Reviews are structured in a way that they ask you self-evaluate your work, review it, tell you why you're wrong and then ask every... single... employee... to recomplete their self-evaluation reflecting answers with nothing better than ""satisfactory"" so that no raise can be justified. It becomes blatantly obvious within the first few months of working here how little the CEO of the company cares for his employees and is sponging maximum profits out of the company till he kills it. This is made more apparently through the customer policies where you are constantly told to basically tell a customer to screw themselves if they don't want to pay the obsurd prices it costs for them to maintain this companies products. You will not leave hardware. Don't let them lie to you in interviews. If your aspirations are to join hardware and possibly work into a different place in the company, forget it. They completely discourage movement from this department and it simply will not happen. The interviewing/hiring process is extensive and intensive. You are tested on a broad range of things and it is seriously one of the most difficult and time consuming hiring screens I have been through. If nothing else, the extremely high turn over rate of this position speaks volumes to the caliber of leadership and employee value. The list could go on, honestly.","1.0
