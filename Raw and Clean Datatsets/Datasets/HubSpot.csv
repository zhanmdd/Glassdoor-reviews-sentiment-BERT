How many other companies hired teachers to teach multiple classes almost every day from March-June? Remarkable: I have never felt like I have been surrounded with so much talent in my career. I am honestly floored by the quality of people that I work with every day at every level of the company. The people here are not only amazing already, but everyone is pushing to be better every day. Transparent: Everything is shared with the whole company. EVERYTHING.

Leaders across the organization have consistently invested in me and my career, allowing me to become more confident in myself and my ability to run a successful team. I have worked in tech for years, and I have never seen the type of transparency that HubSpot celebrates every day. The company will not shy away from addressing topics of concern, and does the work to support our employees through employee resource groups, external resources and beyond. Tech can be known for job hopping, but I am definitely not leaving anytime soon. I have never doubted my ability to continue to grow and learn at HubSpot.","Being an external candidate, hired directly into a management role was intimidating. Often times in decks & internal resources acronyms and historical references make it hard to get onboarded independently without having to ask for clarity. I'd encourage employees to think back to their first day, and create internal resources that are digestible no matter how long you have been working at HubSpot.","5.0

We have a executive leadership team that truly cares about the company and puts a ton of time and energy into making HubSpot a great place to work, a great place to be a customer, a great place to partner, etc. During the pandemic, the executive leadership team hosted ongoing ""Ask Me Anything"" sessions for the whole company to literally ask them anything. It ranges from daily exercise habits to tough questions on how we're handling certain situations...and it's just amazing to see a leadership team this transparent and honest with its employees. It makes so many of us proud to work here and to be a part of a company that will truly leave its mark in the tech landscape. I'm also endlessly proud to have a CEO that truly understands the importance of having strong women on his executive leadership team and on his board of directors. This is all on top of the usual perks that come with a tech company (coffee bar, smoothie bar, on-site gym, glorious, stocked kitchens, etc...)...but those perks pale in comparison to the real heart underlying HubSpot.",Every company has some things that could be better...but those are largely outweighed by all the pros at HubSpot.,"5.0

Day one, we were told unequivocally that Black Lives Matter, that they understand they have work to do internally and need to do better at helping externally, and they are amplifying the voices of their BIPOC consistently. They take Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging extremely seriously as both a part of their culture as well as their business model. I've never been so impressed with a company's transparency and I am only one week in. The benefits are largely standard, but their unlimited paid time off policy is not a trap like many companies. I've heard several leaders say things like ""you should try to make sure you take AT LEAST a week total per quarter"" or ""we have mandatory mental health days."" They pay much more fairly than several prominent tech companies in the area. They have incredible remote capabilities that have made them very versatile and ready for Covid-19. I have no doubts that they will be at the front of leading the world into the new normal of corporate business and saas.","I don't know of any at this time.

The best part of America is that (compared with other countries) we can freely have differing opinions and still be respected. Not. At. HubSpot. Anything that is a typical viewpoint of a conservative is NOT OKAY. The company preaches acceptance but really it's only if you agree with them. It is absolutely, incredibly important to have a diverse workforce but if you alienate regular white guys it's just as bad as alienating any other group.

There are a lot of wonderful accommodations and perks.,"The pay is horrendous. The ""cult-like"" culture rumors are completely true. While the culture claims to be the ""best"", I have seen managers padding results with fake posts on Glassdoor, and I reported this internally only to find nothing was done. The culture is extremely liberal. It is very closed minded in terms of opinions that aren't in line with the company bureaucracy. I'm liberal, but I'd prefer to leave my political opinions and religious beliefs at the door. The work-life balance is somewhat hit or miss. Some teams have more challenging work than others, but the expectations aren't adjusted accordingly. Managers tend to play favorites, allowing personal feelings to impact productivity. Management is a bit underhanded at times. There was a RIF during covid. It wasn't announced, and it was carried out in an extremely underhanded way. The interview process is ok, but they've let a lot of good talent slip through the cracks based on a process that is weighted towards college graduates and being restrictive in terms of compensation.","1.0

Sun Jun 21 2020 15:04:48 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Customer Support Representative,"Cambridge, MA",Former Employee ,Specific Growth Opportunities,I worked at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"Hubspot has undeniably poured money into developing a fantastic facility with many tech amenities. The people are all friendly and there's a genuine camaraderie within departments. The benefits were up to par with a scaling mid-sized tech company and the location was accessible. I really believed in the vision of the leadership team, and the north star of the company influenced each business unit, resulting in a strong combined effort!","The customer support rep job is an entry level job and the only clear pathways available are into customer success and backline support via the product expert role. People successfully transition to other roles, but compared to success and backline support, other transitions are much less direct and have a lower probability, meaning you might be forced to stay in customer support for much longer than you desire. Timing is a huge limiting factor with regards to non-traditional internal transfers -- you might be waiting for the perfect opportunity that you ultimately get passed over on. More on this below, but this is a greater risk because support reps are not paid well. Depending on your background, customer support can be a fantastic entry point into a strong company. But for some, the choice will be between taking a support role for 40k instead of a position that pays a non-negligible amount more at a non-tech company. I believed that I would be able to ascend quickly based on working harder than other support reps, but the internal structures do not incentive outperformers, they reward time in seat. Despite being able to complete cases with rapidity while maintaining a high NPS score, I was not able to take on stretch projects due to my manager tracking ""availability"". While the operation justification for tracking availability made some sense, practically it meant that I was not allowed to work towards my next desired role during my work day despite exceeding the core KPIs of case count and NPS. This is not how a salaried role should be structured. Becoming more efficient at your current role is how you stretch into the next role at any other company. My development was throttled due to this dynamic. Finally, you'll be paid below national market rates at every step of the way at Hubspot. For some people the pros mentioned above are worth being underpaid and experiencing stagnation, but I didn't believe it was a prudent early career decision -- although it might be a valid choice at a more senior position within the company.","3.0

Sun Jun 14 2020 15:24:35 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Software Engineer,"Boston, MA",Former Employee ,Know what you're getting in for,I worked at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"Benefits are excellent. This is a standard mid-sized tech company that's performing well. You'll get excellent medical , dental, & vision, excellent stock options, above-average base salary, a beautiful office, unlimited PTO, and more. The company has done an excellent job of becoming a best place to work for women, and this shows, from the high number of women in top management positions. The company hasn't achieved this by taking a radical feminist stance of trying to encourage women to be more like men and then driving them away in the process, but rather, by valuing women for who they are and creating special benefits that women will enjoy. On site you'll find manicures and pedicures available, and the company offers flexible hours and other benefits so that women with children won't feel they have to choose between their children and their careers. The managers have created a positive environment by genuinely listening to their employees (en masse). This is a company that understands how to hire developers. Developers are given freedom to suggest and implement new projects, attention is given the removing processes which can impede developers, and so on. You really will be working with the best of the best. Your colleagues will be alumni from the best names in the industry, such as Google. Having this company on your resume will improve your job prospects. The company is recognized as being one that hires the best of the best. However, this comes with a caveat that if the job doesn't work out, it can also hurt your prospects because many employers assume that if it didn't work out for you at HubSpot, you must not be a good developer. This is especially concerning given the above-average chance of it not working out for you, which is something I will cover in the cons.","The company has done an excellent job of creating a positive environment for women, but this can lead to double standards. In the office, women make sex jokes of the same nature that you'd expect most women only to make in private with their female friends. It's generally understood that if a male employee were to make similar jokes, he'd be fired. Most tech companies err on the side of not hiring an employee they're on the fence about, in the belief that it's more detrimental to the company to make a bad hire, than it is beneficial to make a good one. HubSpot wants to ensure it doesn't miss out on a rockstar developer. The way it reconciles these two competing interests is by hiring anyone the company could go either way on, but also firing them if, for any reason, it isn't working out after 3-6 months. What this means is it's possible to be hired by the company, placed in a situation in which it's impossible for you to succeed through no fault of your own, and fired three months later. In my case, I was placed on a team in which the tech lead was out recovering from surgery and the person who was supposed to be helping me was unavailable. After six months I was fired without the company ever trying me on a different team. What Dan Lyons wrote about the company only caring about the bottom line is very true. The managers do listen, but only to large numbers. As an individual, you matter very little. I worked 10 hour days and on weekends to compensate for the absence of management I was given. I suggested pairing me to work with someone from another team for just a few days and it was ignored. People knew I was struggling, but not a single one ever offered to help me. The only management I was given was being told that anonymous members of my team had assumed I wasn't doing work, and because the team is more important than the individual, it was my job to figure out how to get them to stop. When I was fired, I saw a very different side of one of my managers. This was someone who was largely respected in the company and regarded as a sensitive, helpful manager. I was told I didn't have common sense and that I didn't belong in the field. I've since gone on to lead projects at major companies and be courted by some of the biggest names in tech, but once the company decides it doesn't need you, you see its real side. The company's approach to management is very passive aggressive. They might hold a meeting telling everyone they don't want them to feel they have to work too long, but privately you'll be told you're underperforming and you need to get your productivity up. Even though the company does take steps to create a feeling that you're around friends, the truth is many of the people will show a different side of themselves once you're no longer with the company. Only one person from the company has kept in touch. The reputation about being the best place to work in Boston is largely hype that the company has created. During the years I've worked in Boston, the only people I've met who wanted to work for HubSpot were college students who bought into the hype. By contrast, I know several seasoned developers who know about this company's reputation and don't want to work here. Everyone in Boston knows someone who knows someone who got overworked by the company and either was fired, or quit. Once you leave the company you'll meet multiple people who tell you they felt the same way as Dan Lyons but were less vocal about it, etc.","2.0

Small teams grant tons of autonomy with very low process/meeting burden.

I’m sure this sounds redundant, but the people at this company are absolutely incredible. Never have I felt so welcomed at a place, and I never feel judged or like I can’t be anything but myself. Along with the people, the culture is also amazing. I’ve gained so much from working from this company.","I will be fully transparent in that when they first hire you, they hype up how much internal growth is possible. That said, they brush over the fact that while they do open applications internally to everyone (no matter your position or team), the Hiring Managers/Recruiters don’t emphasize exactly what level or tier they’re looking for. As of yet, I’ve applied to 3 internal positions and have yet to land any of them. The process is smooth and they even give you feedback afterwards, but I feel as if the feedback is just for show, as I’ve acted on the feedback by doing various things to “up my skills”, but nada. I’m not the only one in my current role (Support), that feels this way. Because of this, I’m currently seeking other job opportunities outside of HubSpot to continue my career growth—because sadly as of right now I feel like I’m stuck in a dead-end in my position. I’ve met with countless people, made connections with, and asked questions to the people on the team I’m looking to join, but it still doesn’t allow me to get hired on the other team.

Norms cause people who otherwise might act differently to act in a way that the norms encourage. The norms at Hubspot are to make people feel welcome and supported, to assume best intent, to be patient and solicitous in helping people grow and learn. One of the most impressive things is that the management relationship is not the kind that makes you feel watched or judged, but managers seem to go out of their way, whether or not sacrifices are necessary, to make sure that you feel comfortable, are not stressed, and most importantly are growing in your role and toward your next promotion. Tech-wise, I have been extremely impressed with the platform tooling at HubSpot. It always ""just works"". I would even put it at contrast with a lot of commercial cloud computing software for its reliability, ease of use, and overall reasonable-ness. And the people who build and maintain it are always solicitous with their assistance if you're having trouble.","HubSpot's systems have grown very rapidly, and they're now quite complex. In some areas there are archeological layers of legacy stuff that has to be understood and worked with, but could and probably should be much simpler. Also associated with the level of growth is a possible lag in onboarding. Currently there is a quick burst of onboarding on some basic tools like Maven and our deployment platform. But after that you're kind of on your own to acquaint yourself with the intricate and often unintuitive product-specific systems that you need to work with. Under the banner of autonomy, engineers are expected to drive the rest of the process by asking questions and giving feedback on how they're doing. For various reasons I think that kind of guidance should be more structured and should mostly come from others, not be solicited by the new hire. Another recent hire and I were talking about this recently and a choice line was ""it's hard when the onus is on you to connect, and you're new so you don't necessarily know what to say, but you have a nagging sense that you need some guidance.""","4.0

I can honestly say I've learned so much in just the 1.5 years I've been here, and I've met some great people along the way. Management really listens to you and gives you honest, constructive feedback that you can put into action to grow your career. They've put a lot of energy into building out their IC track for designers—which is much appreciated since not everyone wants to grow into a management role. They also care a lot about work-life balance and are always ready to revisit priorities when things get a little too busy. From day one, I've seen this commitment from leadership when they hired me as a remote employee after I expressed a desire to stay near family. They care about their employees and have invested in technology that makes it easy to stay connected, even when you're far away.

I've been at HubSpot less than a year, but long enough to be able to get the entire experience (post new-hire honeymoon phase). 1. The best part about HubSpot are the people. HubSpot puts immense weight during the interview process to hire people that are smart, driven, and most importantly kind. I've made some great relationships during the time I've been here, and it makes work that much more enjoyable. Everyone here is motivated to succeed and advance their careers, and it fosters an exciting environment. 2. Company values. HubSpot is a company looking to be profitable like all others, but it strives to do so in partnership with its customers. You've most likely heard all about the inbound methodology, but HubSpot truly does strive to do business holistically and in a way that makes the world a better place. This not only applies to the way HubSpot goes about business, but also the way it treats its employees. You work hard, but I've never worked somewhere that invests so much in individual growth as well as transparency. 3. Benefits and perks. Benefits are great compared to where I've worked in the past. The coffee is fantastic, snacks are good, and beer on tap is great. 4. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. HubSpot puts soooo much into becoming a diverse and inclusive company, and strives to foster an environment of belonging. It admits that it's got some more work to do in this department, but it's truly steadfast in eventually becoming a leader in this category. I can go on and on about my experience at HubSpot. I can't genuinely say how grateful I am for the opportunity to work here.","I don't really consider this a con, but more of a disclaimer to potential applicants: Prepare to work hard. If you want to coast in an easy 9-5 then HubSpot is not for you. If you are coming from another industry, then prepare to put in even more hours learning the ropes and becoming familiar with tech, marketing, sales, and general business acumen. You can quickly become overwhelmed (especially in the beginning). Every employee is here to grow and make a name for themselves, so if you don't give it 100%, you will be left in the dust. This isn't to say that the work-life balance is bad (it isn't). You just need to work hard and hit your metrics in order to succeed.","5.0

Culture at HS goes far beyond the benefits and perks and is truly about the people. – One aspect of the culture that has been meaningful to me most recently is how much the company supports working parents and the flexibility needed to make your personal and professional life work. - We welcomed our first baby to our family last year and going out on leave and completely disconnecting is a really scary feeling. My colleagues, manager and broader People Ops team were overwhelmingly supportive in helping me prepare and even more so leading up to my return. Don’t get me wrong – you’ll work hard at HubSpot, REALLY hard. – This place is demanding, but the work you do will be fulfilling and you can create your own career path (within reason) if you are a consistently strong performer and seek out the right mentorship.

It's the only company I've worked for that has a surprising lack of jerks--that has to do with a carefully cultivated culture and the way that the founders/executive team think and the company is structured. The benefits are significant, but the most important, in my mind, is the unlimited vacation, flexible work possibilities, free books, great medical, and the perk of being able to use the software for personal use--which is super powerful if you have a side hustle. And that side hustle? It's supported and encouraged. Having happy, fulfilled employees make for better employees, and they get that. Oh, and it's a phenomenal tech company for women with over 50% of their workforce identifies as female.","Salaries trend lower than at other tech companies. This has happened because most employees are hired at a young age and work their way up through the company so they don't need to be as competitive. In particular, salaries may be difficult to swallow for older Boston high tech workers (and it may be harder to compete with younger candidates for jobs for that reason--most of the managers are not that long in their careers), but it's worth a shot, because the cool work, great managers/colleagues and the benefits DEFINITELY may offset that con for you.","5.0

Compared to everywhere else I've worked, the company seems so much more accepting of people with a variety of expressions, backgrounds, and experiences. Management also acknowledges that there is always room for improvement (and continues to take action to improve). There are many opportunities to get involved in DI&B initiatives. There are a lot of perks like free food, dogs in the office, an onsite gym, working from home, and expensed team outings. I also view my coworkers as friends. My manager keeps my career growth in mind, and I receive clear and actionable feedback to work towards an eventual promotion. I also have a lot of independence to determine my own schedule/hours and the projects I would like to work on. Initially, I was skeptical of the Unlimited Vacation policy, but I have had no difficulty taking time off. My manager suggested taking off about 4 weeks per year + holidays which is more than what other companies I looked at offer for my role. I can also extend holidays by working remotely.","As HubSpot has grown, the culture and hubspotlife has not fully scaled. For example, the new office expansions (1C and 10C) have substantially fewer amenities and a much less social atmosphere than the main buildings. It's also been harder to sign up for traditions like Mystery Dinner and company outings. For software engineers, the work-life balance and burden of being on call can very greatly depending on the team.

If you are looking for your next technical challenge, HubSpot is a great place to be, and the challenges are getting bigger and bigger as the company scales up. Fabulous platform support. You'll probably never work anywhere else that has bespoke CI/CD tools that are as polished and reliable as HubSpot's. Developing software at HubSpot is a truly fulfilling experience... If you like Java. Top notch executive team. Brian Halligan is probably one of the most customer-centric CEOs in Boston, and Dharmesh Shah is a CTO able to operate at every level from dreaming the big dreams to writing the SQL queries himself.","Not unusual to scale-up organizations, HubSpot has some rough edges around role alignment when hiring externally, promotion paths across the technical and leadership boundary, and sometimes suffers from the downsides of a massively decoupled product org consisting of hundreds of small teams empowered to run fast in the direction they choose. By and large it is working for them, and there are alignment processes in place that get the job done where it matters, but be on the lookout for pockets of unchecked chaos, or unexpected feedback.","4.0

You're an adult, nobody's here to keep tabs on your every move. - Supportive colleagues; the people who work here are pretty great! I've been on many teams over the years and it's always been a net positive experience. Perks like good coffee and snack are nice and all, but they're not going to make you happy at work if your colleagues bring you down. Fortunately, the people at HubSpot are our best assets. - Option to work from home; more efforts lately to make remote work better for everyone! I am local to the Boston area and like to come into the office, but I love having the option to work from home if I need to.","- Demanding; you'll be challenged in your job. Hopefully that appeals to you! If not, you should probably look elsewhere. Personally, there have been times when I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I feel I need to do, but I've always found my manager(s) and team mates to be supportive. - Opportunities for career growth exist, but it takes a lot of work an patience to move into different roles; I don't think this is inherently bad, but it seems to me that as the company gets bigger, it also gets harder to change trajectories in your career.

Walking in the door in 2016, I immediately felt comfortable and at home with my team. I was able to ask questions, be myself and learn everything I needed to learn how to GSD at my role. I was tossed into a fast pace environment and able to give input on how things could be better. My voice was not only heard, but valued. I was able to move up in my role within my first year, have been given accolades for work well done. Now, almost four years later, I am still feeling fulfilled, challenged and happy to get up and work for this company everyday. I have been able to move my working site to remote in order to better address my mental health and to better figure out my life plans. And I, again, was supported in every step of that process. As a remote worker, I am given opportunities to spend time with a whole new community of people. I have the support of a remote program manager who makes sure that we are included in events and opportunities that all the other sites get. And I am able to do the things I need to do to gain a good work/ life balance. So, if you like a job that allows you to get up, live out your morning routine the way you would like, work on projects that are fast paced and exciting, and supports anytime you need... you will probably like it here. (oh, and the unlimited vacation time isn't the worst, either)","The only even remotely small con I have to list would be around definition of roles. But, even then, I feel like if I want to learn something, I can just ask. If I want to try to tackle a new opportunity, I just ask. I have learned that titles do not define the human, the work and the compassion and all that other human stuff does. And I know from a clarity side, this is being worked on and will continue to be worked on as we grow.","4.0

Although we have the opportunity to work from home as much as we want, I find that coming to work reenergizes me because we are all focused on a central vision, to make the customer happy. Shoutout to our leaders for maintaining the culture even as we continue to grow at a fast pace. The company is at a stage where it is really able to invest in systems to help alleviate pain points that could be solved with automation. It helps make the work we do more impactful instead of making us feel like we're toiling away on administrative tasks. Management practices what it preaches in terms of unlimited vacation and work/life balance. It really makes a difference when your director tells you that unless you have extremely critical work (which my team rarely does) you should be taking at least 2 weeks off at the end of the year in addition to time off during the rest of the year. They are also very flexible and understanding that there is a life outside of work. I appreciate the encouragement to make work fit around your life instead of the other way around.","There are some growing pains since the company is growing so quickly. Management is used to moving very quickly, but it might be time to slow down and invest in systems and processes instead of barreling forward and troubleshooting later.","5.0

It is a fast-paced environment with driven people working on solving a lot of different problems for our customers. One of the best things is seeing the growth of HubSpot. The company is remarkably transparent from the top down about how things are going for the business. There are so many reasons why HubSpot is a great place to be. The flexibility is awesome as well as many of the fun perks (unlimited vacation, free coffee, a gym, cool free events to attend, etc). Having worked at a few companies beforehand, I know that it is remarkable to be somewhere that cares about its employees as much as HubSpot does. Finally, HubSpot is a great place to be because you can really grow your career here. There are some many opportunities to grow and gain new skills. If you are interested in trying a totally different job (say you are in sales but then want to become a product manager) you can do it! It requires extra work but the fact that the opportunity exists and that people are willing to just meet with you and let you take on special projects is awesome.","HubSpot is still a young company with some growing pains. There is a lack of diversity (which is a priority for the company but still an issue) as well as some pain around scaling as we grow. There are times that your team will be working on an issue for a few months only to discover that another team is ALSO working on the same problem but the teams didn't speak to each other so no one knew. There is a feeling that HubSpot's salaries are on the lower end of the spectrum compared to our peers. Some of this is true, but I would also point out that HubSpot employees have stock options which is very valuable. That being said, it would be great if HubSpot made public salaries for every role.","5.0

This brings me to my second point that we believe there is always more to learn and encourage people at all levels within the organization to continue to learn and grow. I've not seen that modeled to such an extent with other employers. The organization is fairly flat, which gives folks a lot of autonomy and leverage to bring great ideas to the table and it helps us to better elevate the voice of the customer and truly be understanding our customers' needs by hearing from them directly as well as hearing valued feedback from employees who are customer-facing.","I have left this blank for the last 10 minutes while I am trying to think of something... I don't have many cons, if any. I think there are learning curves along the way as any company grows quickly, but even that has been positive since HubSpot realizes its areas that it needs to improve (increasing diversity, for an example) and has proactively worked towards getting better with this.","5.0

As long as the work gets done, they trust you to work where and when you need to work, which has been so impactful on my work and life and will keep me loyal to the company for years to come. The company also allows remote work, which is an incredible option for those of us who prefer to work from home, are not located close to an office, or may be looking to make a physical move in the future for various reasons. The community: The company is full of empathetic, helpful, and energizing people, which makes it a really great place to work and learn. From the very top level to individual contributors, I've always felt welcome and comfortable reaching out, collaborating, and asking for help when needed. This type of environment also fosters opportunities to branch out of your own role and explore other functions and possibilities, which has been really helpful to my career growth. In the three years I've been at HubSpot, I've been able to transition my career into a new space, pursue a graduate degree thanks to the flexibility in HubSpot's schedule (and their tuition reimbursement!), and grow both personally and professionally in so many ways.

HubSpot pays far below industry standard in all roles, and internal reps are frequently lowballed when being promoted.

I can't speak to the overall strategy, but for the most part, as both an internal and external user, there's been continuous improvement in functionality, and the UI and general ease of use is considerably better than garbage like Marketo and Pardot - There are enough people at this point that you'll definitely find like-minded colleagues. People are generally smart and capable (though there's definitely a Dunning-Kruger effect and HubSpot's internal insistence on its meaningless stat that they're harder to ""get into"" than Harvard certainly doesn't help things), and I've connected with some truly incredible friends and colleagues here","Two main cons, neither an easy fix: 1. The ""Peter principle"". Upward trajectory at HubSpot relies heavily on an eventual promotion to middle management. This is seen as ""prestigious"" or a sign of talent, but the fact of the matter is that across departments, the responsibilities of managers are vastly different from those of individual contributors. Although not universally true, wayyyy too many people get promoted to a management position based on their excellence in their current role, with little regard for whether those skills will translate to middle management (hint: they often do not). HubSpot's only alternative to rewarding excellence besides the management track is pay raises and more senior titles. This isn't all that different from how many other companies operate, but it doesn't absolve HubSpot of its poor managerial culture. As the saying goes, ""People don't leave their jobs, they leave their managers"", and far too many strong contributors are put into managerial roles where they're at best ineffectual and at worst, an active hindrance to employee performance. There's a strong sense that managers view their status at the company as an elevated one, where it should be the reverse: middle managers are there to enable their employees to give their best performance, not to flex their tenure. Ironically, because of this culture, I've seen the converse scenario as well: middle managers stuck in middle management because it's the ""mature"" thing to do, despite being talented and smart enough to be a better fit as senior members of their team. 2. Diversity and inclusion. There's been a strong push at HubSpot lately to be better about diversity and inclusion, which is great to see. The problem is that most of the top-down directives are coming from a place where the top is neither very diverse nor inclusive. About a year ago and a half ago, I personally saw a new POC hire go through the new hire training, and then be let go almost immediately. Apparently, his manager didn't feel that his output was very HubSpotty. I bring this story up because I think it highlights how much work HubSpot still has to do. There's countless research out there highlighting that no matter how much raw intelligence or talent someone from a low-income or low-privileged background possesses, there's going to be a (usually pretty rough) transition period when they move into a more demanding environment. It's not laziness or lack of fit - it's the natural outcome of trying to adapt to completely new environments, environments which are often very familiar to those who were privileged enough to get tutoring, go to schools with AP classes, attend top tier colleges, etc. I'm not suggesting that it's HubSpot's responsibility to fix systemic inequality. I am suggesting that the company should be more patient with those they hire from, to put it bluntly, less ""Martha's Vineyard"" backgrounds. The fact that you would hire someone, put them through a month-long training (in which they've presumably turned down any and all other offers of employment), and then fire them right afterward is... not great. I chalk this one up to the individual manager's inability to empathize or just a general lack of D-I training and awareness, but it's a particularly insidious component to the systemic exclusion at the heart of tech that I don't think is talked about enough.","3.0

Free snacks, a large open office campus plan with plenty of common spaces, smoothie bar, gym, unlimited vacation, etc. The people are generally pretty smart, talented, and hardworking. The intentions are always good, and this is particularly clear when it comes to their diversity and inclusion efforts.

Great health benefits--HubSpot will pay your deductible--and there's a lot of support for parents and caregivers.","HubSpot is finding it increasingly difficult to scale its culture across 9 global offices, and as a result, culture is especially struggling at ""home"" in Cambridge. As the manager corps expands, there isn't enough training or support available to first-time managers. As a result, the company is seeing a lot of turnover--including folks who've stuck around for 4+ years but didn't find it worth it to make it to 5 to get the company's 1-month sabbatical.

They’ve had high burnout in this role due to larger than average customer ratios (think 1:200+ in a bad quarter) and impossible targets. You can only offer a certain level of service at those ratios, which makes it impossible to hit target. This leads to high turnover rates, which causes even higher ratios. Instead of solving the problem, managers blame it on Customer Success Managers not working hard enough and don’t take the concerns of over half of the org seriously, which leads to higher burnout and higher turnover. You see where I’m going with this. Customers can feel the stress in this org, too. HubSpot’s a good name to have on your brand, but if you need a job only stay for a year and then move on. The “Best Place to Work” award doesn’t apply to the Customer Success role.

I learned a huge amount of technical knowledge, which was definitely a huge investment. The snack kitchen, free beer, dog-friendly office space, and technical aptitude of the office was really enjoyable.","Support definitely feels like a cog. You're expected to know more about the whole suite of software than 90% of the company, it changes all the time, you are at work 9 hours a day with an unpaid lunch break, you will inevitably work weekend shifts (though not often), and also work 11-8 shifts, especially when starting out. The salary is not great for support. They recently improved it, but it's still not competitive. It was really hard to move out of support. The job is presented as a catalyst for growth and moving into other branches of the company. And this was true for some, but it interviewed for no fewer than 5 internal jobs and was not given actionable feedback. I had two really poor experiences with managers. When I was there 80% of managers where first-time managers, and I never really felt supported by either one. I was giving mixed messages about my performance. My numbers were always good, but it was always implied that I wasn't working hard enough. These cons added up to a hard to digest lifestyle and poor self-esteem. My manager even suggested I should leave the company because I wasn't happy, instead of asking how she could help. She is a very celebrated manager now. It makes me uncomfortable.","2.0

More often than not, CSMs work an unrealistic and unhealthy amount of hours in order to keep afloat. It is common to witness CSMs trying to one up one another by highlighting how much administrative work they accomplish in one business day and how quickly they manage their call volume and overall workload. These tendencies were then encouraged by management rather than focusing on the quality of our efforts with customers. HubSpot endorses that their staff “work smarter, not harder”, but these rituals are both toxic and taxing. A majority of the Customer Success Manager’s job is to juggle the sheer volume of new customers, which unmanageable long term. There are far too many administrative tasks and unnecessary meetings, which distract from “Solving for the Customer” and allow for less time to be spent on the critical component of relationship building with our customer base.","1.0

The people at HubSpot are also very kind and outgoing, so it's not hard to fit in for the most part. Brian Halligan is the man, very motivating, very enthusiastic, and really cares about his employees, as does Dharmesh. Leadership team is excellent, you'll learn more than you could imagine during your time at HubSpot.","The sales team is huge, and it shouldn't be. I think there's a bit over 500 sales reps, and HubSpot really only needs about 200. The territories are extremely saturated, you're given a few zip codes to work with no matter what vertical of business you go into (small biz, corporate, non profit, etc.) You'll spend about 80% of your time prospecting to companies that have already been reached out to by other reps at HubSpot, so to gain new business can be very difficult unless you dedicate 80 hours of prospecting each week. The sales cycle is long but you have support on all ends to help you finish. Would not recommend being an account exec, but if you start off as an SDR you will definitely learn a lot. They keep hiring more and more account execs which is leading to more than 70% of the sales org not meeting their quota. It is also not very diverse, but then again, not a lot of companies in Boston are. Most of the people are of course white but it's hard to get other nationalities when that's all that is available in Boston. I was one of the few people of color in the entire organization, so of course I felt like we weren't represented very well. Out of the 1000 plus employees, I would say abut 30 or so aren't white. Having said that, I never felt out of place or insulted or anything, everyone is very welcoming. It would just be nice to have more minorities in the crew.","3.0

-Most reps work 9 hours a day and are praised for working over time, despite minimum pay. working overtime seems to imply you are better (from a peer to peer standpoint, and manager to employee)
-Inappropriate to set a metric for ""tickets"" as opposed to ""customers"" at such a high number. I think you would solve for a lot of issues if you hired and trained your support reps in certain areas of the product-- you are doing a disservice to both your support rep and your customer (not setting up anyone for success)
-This role should not be advertised as a way to get somewhere. you need to start hiring people that absolutely love to troubleshoot software--you also need to be way more transparent about the types of troubleshooting that is going to be ""encouraged"" (namely, writing HTML and CSS. This is a huge skill, learning a language... not something to be excluded from a job description or even the interview)
-Speaking of ""encouraged"" troubleshooting... It needs to be way more obvious what a support rep should be responsible for doing. This expectation should begin when the customer purchases the product---and also, make this way more clear during training

In-office benefits like stocked kitchen, gym, beer, and coffee are nice. You learn a lot, and having HubSpot in your resume is always good. Fun place to work if you're new to Boston, or just out of college and looking to network with other young people.","There are many problematic elements about working at HubSpot. Many of them are well-documented in prior reviews so I won’t waste space on them here. But here are a few themes that haven’t been delved into too much here. Work/Life balance Many teams at HubSpot work harder, not smarter. Employees who work long hours are seen as more committed, and more productive. Employees who utilize the “unlimited vacation policy” are often seen as frivolous and lazy. I was encouraged to take fewer days off after my wedding, and even when my spouse was in the hospital. The expectation was you’d always have your laptop “in case anything came up.” If someone left their desk before 6pm, you’d often hear them say something like “I have to go to an appointment but I’ll be back online by 8.” Oftentimes managers would communicate this as well- reinforcing the idea that you needed to be “online” 24/7. Age Much has been said about HubSpot’s lack of diversity. I do believe there’s a good-faith effort to improve this, and I respect the standards they’re trying to set in the industry in this matter. But what they seem unwilling to address is the lack of age diversity. Among all the people I collaborated with at HubSpot, I’m struggling to think of even one person who was over the age of 35. There are a lot of problems with this, obviously, but one thing that stuck with me was the “inmates running the asylum” vibe. Over and over again, major problems were left to a bunch of 25 years old employees to solve. While we (I was one of those 25 year olds) struggled to find solutions, these “crises” could have been solved easily through the lens of experience. Reflecting back, I often think about how every day felt like a fire drill at HubSpot, and I think much of that is because we all had no frame of reference. It was nearly everyone’s first or second job, and we all could have really benefited from someone working with us that had longevity in the industry, or longevity even in an office setting. Ego Now here’s something with a harder solve. HubSpot has an ego problem. Employees are told over and over that they’re the best, the most intelligent, etc etc. and that ethos is internalized by many. There’s a “win at all costs” mentality that causes high tension between employees, and fosters and extremely competitive environment internally. There’s a “watch your back” culture- your teammates WILL undercut you to get ahead. Leaders who’ve had complaints leveled against them time and time again continue to get promoted or shuffled around departments. If you provide results (hit your goals, etc) you’ll be held up as a “golden boy” and protected.","2.0

They are flexible with the employees’ work life balance. So people are very happy, creates a very welcoming and friendly environment.","Do HubSpot employees really have good quality of living though? It is very difficult to live in Boston with this very low salary. I make less than 40 k at HubSpot. There is no transportation benefit, no meals provided, and no bonus unlike other companies. With HubSpot salary, your quality of living is very pathetic. Unless you want to pay very high rent around Boston, you would have to live very far away. For commuters, cooking at home is not an option, especially if your dept requires you to work late shifts. Nobody has time to cook. You either snack your meals with free snacks in the office or spend a lot of money buying food. There are a lot of employees in the office who snack their meals with chips and cereals from the office. They are brining in smoothie baristas next year, but I bet there are going to be a lot of people drinking smoothie to substitute their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I did not sign up for any health benefits because I cannot deduct any more pay from my salary for that. I just suck it up and suffer through if I ever get sick. On weekends, you shouldn’t go out with your friends because you would not have any money to save up for your future. They have “unlimited” paid time off, but they should not call it unlimited because who would be dumb enough to take unlimited paid vacation and get fired? Some employees don’t feel comfortable taking vacation because they always say “Use Good Judgement.” 401k? Their match is a joke. You are not going have a bright future here. It is true that they have fun events and food here and there, but they are not even having employee holiday party this year! HubSpot is making a lot of money right now, all time high stocks. Very strange how employees not benefiting much from this. No holiday bonus, awesome. You will not make any fortune out of stock purchase plans.

I have felt at times as though I'm constantly playing catch-up - While I believe in the mission of helping organizations grow better, I sometimes find myself doubting whether or not I'm truly making an impact on others' lives - marketing and sales software isn't my passion. That's personal, though - Flexibility is a double-edged sword: work/life balance sometimes goes down the drain a bit as a result of seeing that others are online at early/late hours and not defining exactly how much time someone should be spending on work. There are definitely people who manage it well and still crush it at work, but they're few and far between","5.0

No deadlines, no release management, no all-day sprint planning, no daily stand-ups and no sprints for that matter. We work as small teams with great autonomy. I can push my work into production any time I am ready, as soon as I am ready, and only when I am ready. Getting my work done is practically frictionless. HubSpot employees are eager to offer assistance and share their collective wisdom. There are teams of software engineers whose sole responsibility is to make life easier for other software engineers. This place is quite unlike any other engineering organization I've ever worked at.","This is not necessarily a ""con"" for everyone, but HubSpot's employees tilt rather young.

But not smart in a competitive or aggressive way. I've experienced 0 top-down pressure. I feel like I have the freedom to really dive into customer problems and be creative about solving them. HubSpot is customer obsessed and actually means it. The product hierarchy feels really flat. The culture is so friendly and genuine. People just say ""hi"" in the morning even if they don't know you. Simple stuff like that really matters. Also, dog friendly environment, UM WHAT. Amazing. The CEOs don't treat themselves like gods and I literally just saw one of the CEOs (Brian) walking around with his dog. They are very involved, but not in a control-freak type way. Their visions are also sound and reasonable, yet inspiring. They are smart dudes!","It's a growing company so there are some growing pains obviously associated with that. For example, not every team is on the same methodology...some practice Scrum, some don't practice anything. It's a very engineering focused culture with little project management so sometimes that's stressful because you never know what's going on or what the focus is. It feels like there's an aversion to process because they want to keep that ""startup"" feel. As a PM, you really gotta drive that focus or else things feel chaotic. Because each team is autonomous, you can try implementing some new stuff if your tech lead allows you to. The product culture is also learning how to measure success with releases. It seems like a new topic that they're trying to implement. There are some weird product/engineering things that need to be fixed, but it doesn't impact my positive feeling of working here. They just need to be open to new things and adopting practices from the top software companies.","5.0

HubSpot is the first company I've ever worked for where I can count on every one of my colleagues to support me when I need it. Departments are so well aligned in their goals, it's almost always in someone's interest to help you, and vice-versa, even if you work for different teams. - Precision. Brian Halligan (Founder & CEO) recently described this company as a ""laboratory for ideas,"" and that's exactly how it feels. Although the work I do here is consistent with the marketing industry today, HubSpot does it with a precision and at a depth that is hard to come by. You're always given the opportunity to run an experiment or touch a new piece of software that upgrades your business acumen. - Personal growth. You work with people who are so smart and passionate about their work, it inevitably rubs off on you. I can feel myself getting smarter and faster because of the people I work with every day. - Amenities. Free food when you need it. Work from home when you want it. The office is so cozy, though, I usually prefer coming in. :)","The first week of training can be overwhelming depending on the department for which you were hired. A lot of information is thrown at you, and while it is all important, it can be hard to sort out what you'll need to know right away to be successful. This place is a bit of a bootcamp, at least when you start. You work so consistently hard that it's easy to feel swept up in systems and processes that offer little time to digest and ask questions. (You get much better as you go.) Work-life balance is a priority here, but it might not be inherent to your position. It's up to you to find that balance and protect it -- even if that means having some patience and/or a conversation with your manager.","5.0

I've personally found so many opportunities to continue to have an impact and grow and stretch beyond the initial scope of my role. Beyond that, HubSpot cares deeply about its employees and fostering an inclusive environment, which is demonstrated in the continued investment in our employee resource groups, training/development for people managers, and in our benefits.

In some of my previous jobs, that was certainly not the case. At the time, Dharmesh was just releasing the Culture Code and I was immediately sold. The autonomy, trust, and positive attitude exhibited at HubSpot are far beyond any other company I've worked for in my 20-year career. The management team takes the feedback from quarterly (anonymous) employee surveys very seriously and has proven themselves over the years to fix patterns of issues. As a manager, I've learned a lot on how to help people achieve their goals and take on more responsibility. As an engineer, I've been able to carve out time to pursue difficult technical challenges and get recognized for them. The technical infrastructure is amazing, allowing engineers to iterate quickly and ship stuff. Hands down, this is the best job I've ever had and I'm terribly concerned that if I ever have to leave, I'll be very disappointed that my next company doesn't live up to my experience at HubSpot.","The company has grown a lot and while that allows us to get more done, it also drastically increases the coordination and communication needed to launch a project. Sometimes it's not clear who owns what. It's a bit easier for people who have been here a long time, but I think it's really hard on new folks. With great power comes great responsibility. If you're not comfortable shipping things and then being on call in case it blows up in the middle of the night, then HubSpot may not be for you.

The executive team cares deeply about doing the right thing for customers, partners, and employees and building a lasting example of the right way to build a business.","There's plenty we still need to figure out, as a scaling up business we can often move too fast. Some stuff gets rolled out only to get rolled back when we discover unintended consequences. In some cases the left hand doesn't talk to the right and we find changes out well after they happen which leaves us scrambling with individual contributors or customers. Things change constantly so you will always need to be adapting, there's no such thing as resting on your laurels or coasting (for me change is actually a positive, but could be hard for people who don't like change and we can continue to get better at change management.)","5.0

I started about 10 months ago and I absolutely love walking into work every single day. The people, culture, lifestyle, inclusivity, and overall growth of the company are just a few of the incredible things I love being a part of. Even in the last 10 months that I have been here, HubSpot has grown at a rapid pace and it keeps the environment so exciting. The awareness around work/life balance is also very appreciated. 95% of the time, I love coming into work and collaborating with my peers (and playing with all the dogs). But 5% of the time I need a mental health day, or I would rather work from my couch in pjs. My quality of work doesn't decrease - in fact, knowing that I can do that and not feel weirdly guilty about it like I did at my last job, increases my productivity. Thank you, HubSpot, for understanding that sometimes we need to listen to our bodies and take care of ourselves....AND we are still dedicated to our careers. Many companies feel like that is an OR statement.","Double edged sword - with the rapid growth and so many new products being launched, it can be really difficult to keep up.

I feel like we are only in the beginning stages of growth. This is a positive for the company and also for my personal career growth. I'm confident my career will grow as the company continues to grow. People care - Not only are the people hardworking, but I genuinely feel like the people I work with care about me as a person. They care about my personal and professional goals. I come to work everyday feeling like I can bring my whole-self. Diversity & Inclusion - We still have a long way to go to build a ""company our grandkids will be proud of"", but there has been significant progress to make HubSpot a more diverse and inclusive team.

Sat Sep 22 2018 04:43:46 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,Great opportunities but stay vigilant,I have been working at HubSpot full-time for more than 3 years,"The entry level tech support position is a great opportunity for someone like me who's switching career paths or just starting in the software industry. The training is thorough and the experience you get working with customers is EXTREMELY valuable - you can completely start your software career from zero here, and the skills are transferrable if you decide you'd like to work at another company. Once you get out of Support, or if you start at a higher position, there's a strong feeling of belonging to a community and being truly respected and appreciated by your colleagues for people who do good work. The benefits are unbelievable so you'll definitely feel comfortable and taken care of. It seems like you also have some pretty extreme job security because the company basically refuses to fire anyone unless they're a colossal failure, but I'm not sure if I would 100% consider that a ""pro."" I have a lot of negative thoughts I'm going to share below but I don't want it to come across the wrong way - the pros GREATLY outweigh the cons at HubSpot. There are only a handful of positions here where you'll feel under-appreciated and underpaid. If you're smart and responsible, you'll move up quickly and you'll have fun doing it. The culture is fast-paced and challenging in an exciting way, Brian and Dharmesh are absolute wonders to be associated with, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to grow and succeed. The benefits are excellent and will make even the less-desirable positions comfortable. Take advantage of the unlimited time off, free healthy food in the kitchen, crazy good health care, and generous sabbatical!","If you're starting in Support, as many people at HubSpot do, GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. The work is grueling, hours are long, expectations are ridiculously high, and you'll be abused pretty regularly by customers (although this has gotten a lot better since they've put restrictions on who can call into the support phone line). The success of the company is so heavily reliant on support (a lot of customers list support at the top of their reasons for choosing HubSpot over competitors) but no one cares about you at all except for your direct manager (DIRECT support management is amazing, to be fair). Sales and account managers will throw you under the bus or bully you into spending your whole day on difficult side projects for their customers so they don't have to do their jobs. The pay is super low even for an entry level tech support position, and the majority of jobs that are readily available to you after a year or 2 in support come with insultingly measly pay raises. View these positions as stepping stones. You're not getting everything you can out of the company until you're 2-3 steps away from Support. That being said, don't give Support too much of yourself while you're there. You'll get ahead by doing your job well and networking and that's it - don't waste your time on side projects and overtime because it will not benefit you, and the second you show that you're willing to put in extra work, upper management will bleed you dry. Keep your head down and trudge forward if you want to succeed here, and be wary of your low-effort colleagues. For some reason HubSpot refuses to reprimand kids in Support who do *under* the bare minimum and continuously make HUGE mistakes. These people will make your job so much harder because they're looking for every excuse to put their work on your plate so they can go enjoy the free beer. Don't befriend these people, and when their lack of effort starts to effect you, just go right to their manager and move on. They're not worth your time. Now that I'm out of Support I enjoy my job SO MUCH MORE. In fact, this is my favorite job I've ever had, despite the fact that I'm still not getting paid a competitive rate. I'll take the lower pay for a job I truly enjoy and the feeling of genuine respect in the workplace though. The last thing I'll say about HubSpot is that you should be wary of the work culture. Especially when you're in Support, they'll try to distract you with constant social events and parties. It honestly feels like a frat house at times and there seems to be this constant pressure to drink and party, especially when you first start. Like with any other job, just be careful. Go to the social events that seem fun to you or that will actually help you network. If you're going to drink, do so lightly and skip the afterparties. If you're in Support, I would honestly recommend not going to any parties if you can avoid it. Finish your work and go home because otherwise the office will become home and it gets unhealthy really quickly. Since it's so common for people to start drinking at the office, the line of when work ends and time off begins gets blurred and things can get ugly. People have no boundaries and are constantly embarrassing themselves by talking about private/personal things that should NEVER be discussed in the office. Don't be one of them. Trust me, I've made that mistake a few times during my early days at HubSpot and I'm still humiliated.","4.0

As long as you are hitting you're number, you can enjoy the amenities of flexible work (remote).

My favorite part of working here was the learning - from colleagues as well as the Hub Talks where they bring in executives from other companies to share their story.","In sales, it was a bit of an extra grind with monthly quotas which further amplified ""what have you done for me lately"" feeling. There would be pressure to oversell/force a sale too quickly at the expense of hitting a monthly number from your direct managers/directors at points. Managers also are overworked/spread too thin so the employees that work under them get limited development/coaching because their manager is often running around in meetings, interviews, etc... This in turn leads to the 1:1s to be about your forecast and spreadsheets and less on coaching and developing with deals. There was also a lack of development for reps wanting to move into manager roles - a lot of it is left to you with the expectation that you won't get a manager job until having interview several times.","4.0

Short: Really good.,I have been working at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"Every part of the interview process was extremely well thought out and honestly enjoyable from a candidate stand point. The team really puts the effort into understanding your baseline for Inbound and if a good fit after the initial video interview (worst, most awkward part for me) and phone screen making sure the candidate is set up for success when talking to a hiring manager. You definitely get put through the gambit during the onsite portion. I spoke to three managers and two directors in 30 minute sequential meetings. All were great, but particularly the Service Director. It really wasn’t an interview after the first minute or two of talking to him. It was a conversation, and an insightful, engaging one at that. A++ From the minute you’re brought on, you have a huge wealth of freedom and autonomy to just get things.. done. Everyone deeply believes in the company and the product and I may have had one or the other in previous roles but rarely if ever both with other companies. Definitely cool.","Training can at times lack structure. There were times during the two week training you would come in, have a session for an hour and have a blank calendar the rest of the day.

Quit worthy even. The first line of the compensation wiki PAGE says ""provide a compensation structure that is simple, transparent, and rewards over-performance"". The 4K word explanation plus dozens upon dozens of questions proves that it is neither clear nor transparent. There's gotchas, claw backs, this counts for this not for that, it's ridiculous. You gotta do this + that, and you get this, but if you sell this + that under this time period you only get this, add this, divide by this, multiply by that and, well, is your head spinning yet? This really needs to get simplified. It's hard to always solve for the customer when you're also trying to not shoot yourself in the foot. Second, there is no continuous training, not just from a sales coaching/development perspective but on the product in general. It's awesome that we're always innovating on the product, but when there's no structured/programmatic training to keep up with these changes, selling can get tricky. One offs are not going to cut it.

Fri Oct 20 2017 13:00:56 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Director of Engineering,"Cambridge, MA",Current Employee ,This is what I've been searching for,I have been working at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"I've worked in the software industry in the northeast for more than a decade, and while I've been successful there's always been something missing. At HubSpot I feel like I've finally found what I've been looking for (take that, U2). I know that sounds like a big statement but everything I've seen in engineering aligns so perfectly with the values I've practiced and preached, from the top of the stack to the bottom. I don't want to bore you to death with an essay, but here are some of the things that really stand out: * The technical talent on the team is amazing. I've worked with brilliant engineers in the past, but the consistent level of intelligence, capability, and competence here is impressive. * The passion the entire team gives and the pride they take in what we're doing is such a motivator and inspiration. I've read the same stuff you have about the 'cult'; it couldn't be farther from the truth. This is hard working people taking pride in what they've accomplished. * The lack of bureaucracy and process is so refreshing. It's focused on Just Effing Doing It instead of endlessly debating and needing sign-off from eighty nine different levels. This can definitely take some getting used to because leadership is largely just sketching a very rough outline and everyone else is not only filling it in, but erasing the lines and redrawing as they see fit. It can sometimes feel like we're veering around a bit, but leadership does a fantastic job of catching that just as it's beginning to show signs of a problem and correcting it. * I didn't realize how much the politicking at my old company was affecting me until I came to a place where... well... it doesn't happen. There's a real lack of kingdom building or ladder climbing - and instead it's very much a bottoms-up mentality with a focus on what you've done and not how well you play the game. * Competence and excellence are recognized and rewarded. It's not about who you know or what group you're in; if you do awesome stuff it's seen and celebrated. I was so tired of needing to brown nose to get ahead. Here I've told my boss to his face he was wrong, or that I disagreed with our leadership, or that I was going to do something and didn't care what he thought, and rather than being smacked down I was thanked for pushing for what I knew was right. * The culture here is Absolutely. Fantastic. There's an commitment to employee satisfaction that they really do take seriously. There are regular satisfaction surveys, we have people dedicated to making it an enjoyable place to work, the company's very willing to spend money on things that could be considered frivolous - like team lunches, or trivia nights - and any tool you need to do your job better is essentially yours. I'm not naive enough to think that this is all altruism, but it definitely feels like the company cares about us as people. And what's more, that belief and focus is practiced and felt at all levels, by everyone here. I know that all this sounds too good to be true or like I'm a soulless shill, but I couldn't be happier with my decision to move here. If you're looking for a place that dispenses with the crap, does awesome things, hires amazing talent, and treats its employees with respect and kindness you could do a hell of a lot worse than HubSpot. I'm looking forward to many more years here.","This isn't a place that caters to passivity. If you're looking for a lot of hand-holding or you need structure in order to be successful then this really isn't for you. Our entire philosophy is based around small, very technical, autonomous teams, and that requires those teams to be extremely self-driven and self-directing. There's plenty of help if you ask, but if you're expecting someone to give your formal requirements, document the steps you should follow, or shepherd you through your day-to-day you're going to be sorely disappointed. We want passionate, driven, opinionated people who aren't going to sit back and let someone else make all the decisions. Our lack of structure and process is almost a negative, and I'll be the first to admit we probably need a little bit more. We're growing rapidly but we don't do an amazing job of defining defaults that lead people to the right solutions, which means every new tech lead or engineer has to figure a lot out for themselves. I think we could stand to do a better job structuring things (just a tiny bit more!) so that people fall into success more easily.","5.0

Thu Oct 19 2017 05:36:26 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Implementation Specialist,"Cambridge, MA",Former Employee ,The Most Racist Professional Experience Ever,I worked at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"Kitchen, Gym, Technology, Entertainment, Meditation Room","This is my second time writing a review about HubSpot because I was coerced into removing my criticisms by a third party. Instead of contacting me about my concerns as a former employee, HubSpot decided to reach out to someone that is tangentially connected to this situation for feedback on an experience that he knows nearly nothing about. HubSpot epitomizes what is wrong with the world today and is a remarkable example of modern day discrimination, cultural insensitivity, institutionalized racism, implicit white bias and income inequality. Martin Luther King, Jr. once wrote that ""most whites in America proceed from a premise that equality is a loose expression for improvement."" I stand by my belief that HubSpot is not diverse in the faintest sense. After having to defend my initial ANONYMOUS post, I actually think that my original grade for effort on diversity of a C is too generous and an F is more appropriate. Their 2016 numbers speak or themselves, they're 85% white. I was uncomfortable being the only black individual in a new hire cohort of 50+ people. My manager triggered stereotype threat with her poor word choice in our one-on-one check-ins. She made culturally insensitive remarks and didn't care about how her management was disrupting my learning experience. I was progressively profiled and given exit papers over the course of three weeks, which makes me wonder why I wasn't interviewed more thoroughly. Firing someone during on-boarding is essentially condemning their learning style. The CEO's personal commitment to diversity is not permeating the organization in a meaningful way.","2.0

I hang out with my coworkers outside of work, because I actually like them. - There is so much opportunity to make an impact - Being B2B means that our users are using this software day in and day out and running their businesses on HubSpot, which gives you a lot more reason to care about the customers vs working someplace like Facebook - People are generally automonous with the right level of communication - Meetings are kept to be as few as possible, as few people as possible, as little time as possible, as productive as possible, so there is plenty of developer time and no time spent in unneccessary meetings - People work around 40 hours a week, NOT 50-60 - No the unlimited vacation doesn't mean you can just not come to work, but it also doesn't mean you can't take time off. People take more time off on average than companies with a fixed amount of PTO. I'd rather not have to save up time off just in case I need it than have my leftover PTO paid out when I leave. - Working from home is not frowned upon - Upper management is transparent - It never gets boring because we never get complacent, everything is always changing, growing, moving forward - No deductible on health insurance","Everything I can think of to put here is things other people might not like, like all the change and fast pace, but I don't see that as a con myself","5.0

I find the work to be challenging in the best way. I've got a manager who supports me wholeheartedly, an executive team that listens and takes action, and peers that are insanely smart, talented, and driven. I've been given the tools I need to succeed, but I have to work hard to provide value for our customers and hit my numbers. Something I really appreciate is that the company practices what it preaches with HEART and our mission. Being in such a transparent workplace is even better than I expected, and the company is open when we aren't meeting goals. It's pretty cool to see it all in action. Another thing I really value is the number of opportunities I have to get involved outside of the 9-5. A few awesome things I'm involved with are Women at HubSpot, People of Color at HubSpot, HubSpot on the Town, book clubs (thanks, free book program!), Healthy at HubSpot, and even a Ru Paul's Drag Race fantasy league.","It is an incredibly fast-paced place, so it's not built for everyone.

You take what is needed and the team absorbs your absence with a plan. - People care about other people - so much that we'll often sacrifice our own goals to work on someone else's project that requires our expertise so that it succeeds. - If someone spills coffee in a meeting, the following will happen without fail: the closest people will drop their surroundings to help, the people on the outer ring will look for paper towels, and then the hive mind solves the problem. - The company structure changes every year, to best facilitate problems that need to be solved in the near future.","- Free waffles on Wednesdays occasionally gets cancelled - Boardgame nights start way too late in the day - Mystery Dinners (eat with a C-suite, chat, paid by HubSpot) favors a younger crowd without family commitments - HubSpotters feeling ""entitled"" to company perks (like all three mentioned points mentioned above) - On a more serious note, the company structure will occasionally make employees lose morale.

Wed Sep 20 2017 15:56:53 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,Great place to thrive as a high performer,I have been working at HubSpot full-time,"If you're dedicated and self-motivated, you'll do very well at HubSpot. It's not and never will be a place to blend into the scenery. You've got to do more than your job description and be eager and proud to do so, and I think that's where the ""drink-the-kool-aid"" comments come from. As you'll see, I'm solidly not that, but I love HubSpot, warts and all, and I firmly believe that the company has nowhere to go but up. I've seen people go from zero to near-C-level in under two years here. Is that everyone? Of course not. HubSpot absolutely means it when they say you can be a high-performing individual contributor your entire career (I am one). But for people who want to move up the org chart, and have the chops to do so, HubSpot absolutely provides the framework and the support to give someone that chance. The perks are nice. Beer and unlimited vacation and a barista and all that good stuff is nice, but it's actually secondary. Because we have those perks, it means we only have people who can have those perks and not abuse them. The caliber of the ""average"" HubSpotter is anything but average. Every single HubSpotter has something to learn from and be impressed by.","Remarkably few. One, because HubSpot is willing to take risks on people and helps them move up the ranks, people sometimes do get promoted before they're ready for it. There's nothing more demotivating than a bad manager, and I've seen entire teams underperform for months while a bad manager is either coached or replaced. I'm not sure there's an easy fix here. On the whole, it's a good thing that HubSpot gives those people those chances. There probably needs to be more guardrails and mentoring around this to identify where a newbie manager is potentially having cascading negative effects. Second, and this one is some tough love from me, but it needs to be said: You need to toe the line on some things. If you're politically conservative, keep it to yourself. If you're liberal, preach it from the rooftops. HubSpot, for all its diversity and inclusion efforts (which are admirable!), does not allow for certain political viewpoints to be shared at all, and certainly not respected. On the one hand, it's not surprising that the majority of the company is more liberal. However, the Women@HubSpot and LGBTQ Alliance use Hillary Clinton campaign slogans in their ""official"" materials. I get it, I'm solidly liberal, and I don't think it's done with any sort of malice, but I've seen people basically shouted down and degraded for expressing any view that isn't solidly on the left side of our political spectrum. I know a few conservative folks at HubSpot, and I know for a fact they fear for their careers to even engage in debate on certain issues. It's never good for anyone to feel silenced, and in this manner, it's happening here. It's a glaring dark spot on HubSpot's supposed openness, and it needs to change. I am sure that it will in time, but it's something to be aware of if you are in that set and are considering HubSpot to work for right now. Hopefully in a few years, this won't be the case.","5.0

Amazing expansion and yet feels like an small company. Great culture (on paper). Good benefits. Amazing facilities - it does make your job easier. If you're part of the company where people live, work by the company's culture deck, congrats you must be having the time and experience of your live. If any of the cons below sounds a bit familiar, move within or out of the company, seeing those things in 2017 is not worth it.","Subtle misogyny and sexism exists. It's saddening things like: ""Be careful on what you write on interview reviews, European candidates can request transcripts"", and those emails are not talking about confidential information but about language, disguised sexist jokes. I've seem post-interviews starting with: let's hire the attractive one to boost moral. Jokingly comments like: Be impartial even though girls are not you thing - directed to a male employee. Upper management acting inappropriately towards other employee, making suggestive (and highly questionable) comments on private subjects. It's not rare to hear comments like ""That's how that person is"" or "" They do a great job, it was just a silly comment"", when things like the ones above described come up in conversations.

Being here for a little over a year, I've seen us scale in number of employees, overall revenue generation, perks, and professional development opportunities. We've seen hardships along the way, but I can honestly say that 80% of the changes we've made have been undoubtedly for the betterment of the company as a whole, and have spilled over unto us as individuals, to enrich our daily work life. Our constant push to always be improving really affects each of us in unique ways, and in my opinion it's always for the better. One of the top reasons I stay at HubSpot is because of the work/life balance and flexibility to make your own schedule. Although my friends and family may not at times think I have the best ""work/life"" balance, the way I structure my time is completely up to me, and I capitalize on our Unlimited Vacation policy often. It's incredibly refreshing to be able to map out your own days and schedule, and be able to enjoy things in life outside of work, whether they are during the typical work day or not. I've been able to grow on my own at HubSpot in numerous ways due to the autonomy that has been given to me, and our Culture + L&D teams have done tremendous work in making sure that outside and internal trainings are available and top of mind to anyone who would like to attend. There are so many leaders here that actually care, and it's just an amazingly collaborative environment that I feel truly stems from our upper management and executive team in a trickle down effect.","Although we are self-proclaimed ""policy averse"", there are times when policy and direction are paramount to success, and I think we fall flat there in many areas. I think we can do a better job of operationalizing our day to day, without losing sight of our customers as the main focus. I think in a lot of ways HubSpot isn't a company that appeals to everyone, and I think we need to change this approach as we grow. While this may be okay when we are a mid-sized company, this won't be an optimal way to operate once we become very large. There are many ""cultural issues"" we face as an organization, and while I feel our company culture is mostly positive, I think there are pockets of teams here that operate in ways that wouldn't work for every type of background/personality/culture, and in my opinion we need to look outside of our bubble more often to create a more conducive environment that serves all types of people around the globe if we want to stay relevant as a Global leader in our industry.","5.0

I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better tech company in the area, especially as an engineer. Business wise, stock and metrics continue to improve. Growth is difficult to sustain and not easy, but I'm bullish that we will continue to find ways. The company is not perfect, but the best thing about the culture is that it is willing to admit faults and improve where things are not great. * increased investment and revamping of training and leadership * always introspective, refining, improving processes and culture * transparency of operations and business from top down * growing, lots of hiring, opportunities to move up * great office, perks (coffee garden, tea, barista, ping pong, beer, snacks) * strong, trusted leadership * smart coworkers * flexibility in time * overall a fun environment to work in, great social events * autonomy, power to have impact","Naturally as the company has grown, the only constant has been change - which is fine. But HubSpot, like most growing startups/scaleups is not great at change management. There is good transparency, but that does not necessarily equate to good communication. There is thrash at times because the org structure does not support the goals that leadership sets for the company (which seem directionally correct, but execution is lacking). The company is very young and lacks diversity in many areas (race, women in leadership, etc), though there is a genuine effort to improve here.","5.0

Hand-in-hand with the transparency, many challenges/opportunities are available for anyone in the company to take initiative on. Moreover, I've always felt that I have the autonomy to manage my work schedule and design my own approaches to solving problems. The people of color culture is great, and it's fantastic to see enough people who truly gets it and care about it enough to push through with many initiatives to drive D&I.","The compensation is considerably lower than market value, and raises will get you stuck perpetually in catch-up mode because they're positioned as % raises. As HubSpot has grown, I have felt the business > team > individual paradigm of ""use good judgment"" erode. Now it feels more like team > individual > business. More time is spent ""talking about talking"" to see which team gets the credit rather than simply doing a piece of work that benefits the business. Team priorities are set up similarly so forget about helping another department with something quick (even if it takes <1 hr and has a high impact on the business) because ""it's not on the roadmap"". The only ways to overcome this has been to either positioning the ask so they see what's in it for them or going to upper management. I've seen many top, A-level people leave as a result of either compensation or bad management, reducing them from someone who was tremendously helpful to others to having to deal with politics and become jaded.","3.0

There is nothing that fires me up more than being on a growing team and moving from a mere application, to a stack of tools, to eventually a platform and figuring out how to become a facebook, amazon, oracle, etc. catered to SMBs. The possibilities really are endless for the company from that perspective as they have gone from Marketing tools, to Sales tool and more. As an individual contributor, the possibilities are endless as well for what career path you want to carve out assuming you can over perform.","What makes me nervous as we push to this idea of becoming a platform, is the speed in which we do it. I've worked for companies where they thought the timing was right to add fuel to fire and as a result essentially spontaneously combusted because things needed to be ironed out internally first before truly thinking up hyper growth. Also, transparency I think is becoming more of an issue. As an organization who preaches how transparent we are, I think this has become a little distant compared to years past for front line employees to the c-suite....even though we say we are transparent. January is shockingly not that far away and I think there is a ton of unknown still on a month to month basis.","4.0

Mentality is come in, get your work done, and leave. Managers never expect their people do be at their desks just for face time. - People are encouraged to think outside of the box and if there is a better way to do something you are encouraged to speak up and recommend/implement change. You never hear anyone say ""well that's how we've always done it so we can't change""","- Company is growing very quickly and is in scale up mode. Always a lot to do, pace can be very hectic and you have to expect and be comfortable with constant change. This kind of environment definitely isn't for everyone. - There is a decent amount of ""group think"" on various topics given the young demographic of employees and the company's front line leaders. If you don't feel the same way about certain topics there is a tendency for the ""group"" to dismiss your opinion - you'll need to be comfortable speaking up and challenging people if you want your voice to be heard and you're not aligned with the vocal few that are passionate about the topic at hand.","5.0

Do it here.,I have been working at HubSpot full-time for more than 5 years,"This place has pushed me in a lot of ways -- it's almost overwhelming the number of different skills, tactics, knowledge, frameworks, etc. that I could choose to focus on and learn from my colleagues, customers and prospects. I love the autonomy, I love the opportunity to move around internally and work cross-functionally. If you are comfortable seeking out opportunities and taking big jumps in your career, this is the place to do it. Brian Halligan, Dharmesh Shah and JD Sherman are some of the most transparent (and very different from each other!) leaders I've ever worked with. The fact that we have access to their thoughts, concerns, vision, etc. in REAL TIME and at our fingertips at any minute means we can all do our jobs that much better. Plus - you can't beat the community, friendship, and honestly, family that you meet here. I spend more time with my co-workers than my actual family, so they better be good people. And let me tell you - they are. Some highlights over the years -- I've worked with executives who have opened doors for me and written recommendations that I would never have even met in person at a different company. I've had a diverse set of mentors that seem to have fallen in my lap -- something I never found though sought at other companies. I take classes every year that HubSpot pays for to help me add to my skillset and my value to this (or any other) company. I work when I want, where I want, and have a team to support me. I have a manager whose #1 goal is to see me get promoted and succeed, whether it's on her team or not. I have equity as a top performer. I get to travel globally to meet customers and speak at events.","Things have certainly changed over the course of the past half-decade (what company doesn't when going from 300-1500+ employees that rapidly?) We've retained our culture but our processes and day-to-day workflows have certainly changed. This isn't a con so much as a result of growth that any employee must learn to adapt to at any growing company. If you're thinking of joining -- know that you are NOT joining a startup. The culture feels like it, but experience in a larger company and how to navigate throughout an org will be a huge value add. You're never going to get paid the highest salary at HubSpot. It's just not the case, but there is huge opportunity and benefit outside of your annual salary. Read the last paragraph of my Pros section -- if you care about money more than these things, you may find this as a con at HubSpot.","5.0

In fact, one of the main reasons why people come to the office is to be with their peers and everyone is an expert at something. The open work environment is great for collaborating and it's easy to speak and chat with someone for almost anything - work related or otherwise. The folks here give a damn about their job and it's a wonder why most everyone is very successful at their jobs and stay to advance, or move on to better things.","The hustle and grind. It's fine to have a busy work day but for some positions, it's unreasonable to 'solve for the customer' for every customer each and every day. Some positions tout 'having the flexibility to control and manage your day' when it's simply not true with customers demanding more and more when you only have so much to give on a daily basis. Some positions are better off than others; there's 'unbalance' between various services positions that brings one's fully booked, back-to-back day into question against someone else with 'nothing to do.'

Sat Feb 11 2017 22:01:30 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Support,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Beautiful Company Inside & Out,I have been working at HubSpot full-time for more than a year,"Unlimited vacation (omg?), candy walls, well stocked pantries, lovely office space and the list goes on, but I thought I'd narrow it down to the top 3 intangibles (aka things you won't see from pictures/articles) 1) Work life balance. Love the point of 'making your work fit into your life'. It feels truly awesome going to work and doing your best with wonderful (or any adjective that's synonymous with super amazing) colleagues who tough out the day together; it ain't easy, but that's why it's fun. Why work 12 unproductive hours when you can work 8/9 good ones and enjoy the well deserved break at the end, right? 2) Genuine effort by management to engage with staff at all levels It is very heartening to see executives leaving personal notes on replies (eg., Glassdoor) by employees because it shows that they truly care. Beyond the gesture, I think it speaks volumes of the transparency and accessibility all employees enjoy within the company. 3) Career development The career development track in HubSpot is so so so clear. What I really LOVE about it is the fact that everything is so well defined through metrics, definition and time frame (as with everything else in the company actually). The beauty of this system is it gives you ample time to prepare/gear up for the outcome, while also giving you a well structured and balanced framework to measure your current performance against the target- no ambiguity there + accountability for personal growth.","1) Feedback channels get abit messy/ convoluted This is a tricky one because it's difficult balancing openness and feedback efficacy. The issue with having an open door policy with almost anything that goes on in the office, is that yes, you get fantastic feedback that could bring about the next big change, but on the other hand, it's getting pretty messy (with the company expanding so quickly). Surveys and regular 1-on-1 sessions with managers are effective in garnering qualitative responses, which are useful in identifying pain points/ suggestions. But the issue arises when qualitative responses are gathered through open channels (i.e., internal forums/ company wide surveys); discussions get increasingly lengthy and difficult to measure. Is there a way to streamline the process? 2) Updates about the development of global offices With the company expanding pretty rapidly, it would be great to know how the other offices are doing (i.e., growth plans / head count) because this gives employees more time to chart their career growth based off what is currently in works.","5.0

In many ways it's inspiring and challenging in raising the bar; it also reinforces that this is the way you should feel about the people you work alongside with (ie a team). HubSpot recruits for very particular values and has a process that is proven to work, and nurtures employees to those values to ensure they grow too. HubSpot's software has come so far in the years that I've been there, and is now a world-class technology stack. The product team that we have is incredible in liaising with people on the ground so that we have a constantly evolving and improving vehicle for customers to derive growth from. This happen - ie bugs, but they work tirelessly to do right by our customers. This ideology of ""solving for the customer"" is present in every being at HubSpot, and I love that. This means that we aren't selling something and leaving that person hanging, it's about ensuring that they know how to use it, apply it to their business, and learn from it so that they can own their own growth. That is really powerful stuff that makes it easy to be passionate about selling. Seeing the results that they achieve is pretty incredible too. HubSpot also let me move to being a remote employee - I am so thankful for being given that opportunity. If you propose an idea and it makes sense (quantitatively first, then qualitatively), HubSpot is willing to try just about anything. That is a really empowering feeling.","Big changes happen frequently within the sales organization and the admin is sometimes difficult to transition to. Sales team is also very political. Selling Marketing Automation isn't easy, requires a lot of work to first learn, then qualify, differentiate, and close. We find that 18months in is when reps start to hit their stride, and it's true. Inbound leads only is a thing of the past - you have to prospect outside of what you are given if you want to be successful","5.0

Fri Dec 30 2016 17:55:40 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Senior Product Designer,"Cambridge, MA",Current Employee ,My People,I have been working at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"1. Hubspot has values. At my first company meeting, I discovered Hubspot hired Ta-Nehisi Coates to speak at their yearly conference. If you don't know Ta-Nehisi Coates, he writes about being a Black man and a Black father in the United States. You can't have a speaker like Ta-Nehisi Coates and feign indifference. Being someone who also cares about Black people and issues of racism, I was so grateful I started crying at the company meeting. Hubspot was willing to ruffle feathers and lose business to stand behind someone they believe in. It was refreshingly honorable. 2. Hubspot hires people who are both sharp and kind. At almost every job I've had, someone has always made me feel small or uncomfortable. At Art.com, a woman would completely ignore me whenever I'd try and communicate. I'd try to talk to her in the hallway and she'd act like I'm invisible. It made me feel horrible and it made me incredibly inefficient at my job. At Hubspot, I've never met someone I haven't liked. Consequently, I'm a happy person, I collaborate easily with new people, and I'm efficient in getting work done. 3. Hubspot is a big company with a small company feel. Big companies get overly political and bureaucratic. Culture is often lost and you quickly become a bee in a hive-slogging through process after process to get your job done or to accomplish any HR task. You feel like your voice is lost. Hubspot has maintained an incredibly friendly, free atmosphere as a 1500 person company. There is a shared culture of getting things done, putting ones ego aside, and asking questions. Everyone is responsive and accessible from the Head of Culture to the VP of Product. You're empowered to do what's best for your team and to lead your own charge in your own way. 4. Hubspot has great design managers. It's common to promote the loudest, most extroverted, outspoken people. Hubspot is different in that they promote a variety of personalities into management positions. My boss is a soft spoken, incredibly empathetic person. His boss (the head of our department) is a super creative, nurturing type who's always looking ahead and reexamining the way we work to ensure we get what we need. My therapist says I've never been this happy. She says all this time, I've just been looking for a good manager. So what about that Disrupt article that guy wrote-the one that talks about how Hubspot is a frat house filled with 20-year-olds? Here is what I can say: - I had read the article and I was skeptical about the seemingly very young people who interviewed me. - They won me over in minutes with their smarts and lack of ego (to me, this has nothing to do with age). - I've never experienced any of that fratty behavior in Product.","I moved to Cambridge from Oakland, California. Winter is cold. I could do without the winter.","5.0

Wed Dec 21 2016 08:02:56 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Cambridge, MA",Current Employee ,What the *&^ is wrong with this place? (Hint: all the right things.),I have been working at HubSpot full-time for less than a year,"*Transparency* HubSpot shares all company performance data, financials, and executive meeting notes with all staff. Other companies don’t do that. Other companies hoard, and filter, and release bitesize chunks of “digestible” information to their frontlines. But HubSpot's commitment to transparency means that every employee deeply understands how the company works, why the strategy is what it is, and why our execs make the decisions they do. It also empowers every employee to knowledgeably identify opportunities to improve the company — our founders openly share their thought processes (and their concerns and their blindspots) because they want everyone at HubSpot to have a founder’s mindset. You’ll learn more about business, leadership and decision-making in 1 year at HubSpot than you could at any business school. *Dynamism* Our leadership team refuses to fall into complacency. Good is not good enough. Even if we’re beating the industry average on some measure, if they know we can do better, they will push us to do better. They’re not afraid to break what works in order to find something better. Other companies would be happy to make small tweaks to earn incremental progress. At HubSpot, you’ll learn best practices, but you’ll also learn to constantly challenge the status quo, whether that’s around sales tactics, go-to-market strategy, product innovation, or customer service. *Professional Growth* Many entry-level employees will start with concrete tasks and a clear plan, but as you grow, you will increasingly have to define your own roadmap. You will be expected to experiment (and fail), you will be expected to digest as much knowledge as possible (through coffee chats and devouring the internal company wiki), and you will be expected to take advantage of unlimited free books and thousands of dollars available to support classes/training. Other companies puts people in boxes and make them climb a pre-defined ladder; HubSpot takes a build-your-own-adventure (with some guardrails) approach to professional growth. *Autonomy* Use good judgement. Take as much vacation as you need. Work from wherever you are. And get sh*t done. The results you produce matter more than whether you’ve followed every instruction in some hundred-page employee handbook (see: other companies). Some people prefer structure, rigid expectations, clear lines of authority, etc. — there’s nothing wrong with that, but that’s not HubSpot. If you like freedom + delivering on high expectations, you’ll thrive at HubSpot.","Many of the things that make HubSpot great are also the things that can be frustrating. *Autonomy* Lots of autonomous individuals and teams acting in loose harmony can lead to duplicative efforts — e.g., two smart people both recognize an opportunity and chase after it without “someone in charge” recognizing that they’re doing the same thing. *Transparency* Holy torrent of information. Given how much information and data is made available, it’s sometimes hard to know what I should know and care about. At best, this can simply be a time suck; at worst, it can be overwhelming. *Manager Growing Pains* As the company as grown rapidly, we’ve promoted a number of first-time managers. Young staff look up and say, “Hey. I could be at least as good as that manager!” Which leads to frustration, more inexperienced managers, and misaligned expectations about what professional growth should look like at its best. I think we've recently made a number of good investments to alleviate some of this pain. I understand that these downsides are inevitable given the choices we’ve made. I wouldn’t have chosen differently.","5.0

We've gone from a scrappy startup to a legit business. While quite a lot has changed, the reason I joined is the reason I stay - I'm constantly surrounded by bright, engaged, dedicated colleagues. People who work at HubSpot really care about the company and we've continued to attract exceptional talent. What this means for me is that, while the business has evolved, I've never had to have a meeting with a manager who's too busy to help or a colleague who's disengaged. This is a drama-free environment because the people who work at HubSpot are here quite voluntarily. HubSpot is generous with employees - but it's not over the top. Motivation to be work here is largely *intrinsic.* We're not here for a free breakfast, lunch and dinner, free dry cleaning, or whatever nonsense other tech companies divert into retaining employees. I find my managers, my colleagues and my team are here because they love the work. And when you enjoy your work and the people you work with, it's an awesome place to forge a career.","As we grow, it's been difficult to keep track of what's going on across the business.

HubSpot is a place where people really pour their heart into their work. Many do it because they believe in HubSpot's mission, some do it because they believe in their team and their coworkers, others because they want to succeed personally. But the one common thread with everyone I've reported to, worked alongside, and even hired, was the passionate commitment to doing their best work here. This has led to me, specifically, experiencing an incredible amount of personal growth - as I'm constantly learning from amazingly wise and intelligent people.","HubSpot's grown rapidly over the last several years, and despite our 'startup like culture' (which is a phrase that has become ubiquitous and meaningless) HubSpot is a big company. Our cultural values have helped us maintain a high bar for employees, but there's a near-constant battle being fought against complacency, routine, and excessive process. You really do drive your own success here, but you'll occasionally need to carry the weight of others on the way to the top. If you come in with the expectation that HubSpot is a mythical unicorn that every employee rides off into the sunset, you will be disappointed.
