On the flip side, when they need to catch up from those grace periods, you will work 60 to even 70 hours a week. Both can be interpreted as good if you have no self-value. *You do start at 13.50 an hour(13.00 for first shift). I have no clue how they can afford to shell this out to the hundreds that worked/have worked there. *They're closing now, so if you're hired on you get incentive for sticking around until the end, if your sanity will last that long. *Your breaks are paid, which is indeed nice if you ignore the fact there is only 2 of them lasting 20 minutes. *The survivors of this apocalypse of a company are absolutely terrific to work with. I'd say about half are absolutely out of cares to give. The other half rant all day while they do their job at 130%. But each have become a wonderful friend to me. *There are safety and wellness committee meetings you can go to for information and advice. *The benefits were not bad at all. You do not have the time to utilize them.","This list that I am about to write could never include all of the issues that I have for this establishment. It is an absolute plethora. I almost don't even want to start, because it will never be enough. *You will never move up. You will never be recognized for your work. If you take time to clean, organize, or generally assist the workfloor whatsoever, even timely and reasonably, you are penalized. If you can't write it as ""off-standard"" without a coach's permission, your numbers take a hit, you get paid less. This leads to layers, layers, and layers of dust, dirt, grime, probably dried tears as well. *I have only met 5 people in my YEAR of employment who were able to stay for more than 3 months in my own department. *Speaking of departments, don't get used to your own. Once you bust your rear end to finish your own department, you are sent to another one to help the people who couldn't do the same(probably temps((see pro #1))). This makes everyone pace themselves to the degree where we ride the minimum until 10 to 12 hours was over. *You get notified of 1 or 2 hours overtime about 3 hours prior. *They have people sorted into keys to be called in for overtime, one for every day of every shift. They do this really cool thing where they make some keys work A LOT more than others :) if you're key 1 or 2 you're good though. *While it is to monitor your productivity and progress, you are perpetually monitored. Sure, it's through security cameras, RF scan logs, and your own timesheet, but it's also through your team lead, as he likes to watch everyone from the catwalk on busy days for quite a bit of time. *As I have referenced, your productivity is measured and you are paid incentive based on said number. They have ""engineered"" standards set in place. These ""engineered"" standards do not measure all that you encounter in a job(which is acknowledged daily by coaches and team leads), so you are essentially pinned against an arbitrary value for a living. * Having a grand total of 40 minutes to yourself for 10 hours a day is stressful. Luckily, there are numerous system failures, system downtime, and general breaches of network integrity to give you a little break from the hustle and bustle of productivity.","1.0

She didn't follow company standards that I had been following for over the 3.5 years I was there. She was not a team player. It just really shows how much can change when you have a bad manager. She couldn't hire anyone and failed to do most of her managerial duties. Also Payless was super crazy with making sure we went through the ""customer journey"" with every person who walked through.

I worked there for 5 years before quitting to stay home with the kids. While there, i learned about the store layout, inventory, receiving and verifying shipments, rack representation, deposits, opening and closing procedures, interview process, training, conference calls, coaching, Crm, UPT/DPT, conversion, etc. I had learned almost everything the manager had known.","Hours in winter, they are open until 9pm when NO ONE is outside. They complain about payroll, but corporate doesn't realize you paid us 2 hours of just cleaning, rack repping, and running shipment. No growth within company from associate. At least, not under my manager, or DM. Too much responsibility for a shoe company to give its new employees. If you want your stores to look neat, tidy and full then you need to spend the money on payroll. Have the right amount of staffing in order to do the jobs required, instead of making 1 person do the task of 3+. ""You have to spend money to make money"". There should always be a manager on spot, there was hardly ever a manager in when i was closing. I had to step up and handle the customers complaints or give them corporates number. Conversion is a waste of time and stress. If my numbers are sales are high, then people are buying. You have no idea how many of the same people walk in and out in 20 minutes. Conversion is stupid. Get rid of it. Also, they need mens shoes. If your not going to offer a great variety of mens, then make it a store for women. It's pathetic. The men's shoes are more expensive (because it's a rarity) so we would be making more money on them If they offered more styles. Same with boys.","4.0

This is not to say it's a bad job, because I have had a lot worse! But it is not a job that would be worth putting more than a year into. It's more of a transitional job that you dont stay at for very long so you can find something better. They are VERY customer based, but not very employee based.

I swear to God you will regret working for this company. Don't get me wrong, in some places it was okay. I worked at stores in South Carolina and in Florida and the store in South Carolina was fine. But the company as a whole is garbage. They care more about the bottom line and saving money than anything else, which I understand if your company is dying and you're desperate to stay in business. Honestly I don't see them lasting though. Regardless, they do not hire enough people to adequately cover the stores, corporate has no regards as to who they lay off and when. In last year there they closed hundreds of stores and cut several departments in the corporate office itself. One of those rounds of cuts happened the week of thanksgiving, happy holidays to those poor saps. But if you must work for the company, all I advise is to absolutely avoid Tampa, FL. Period. Every manager I have worked with in this area is walking human garbage. My friend's manager harassed her to the point of making he so uncomfortable she quit. My manager was a GL who oversaw her manager and he actually faught to keep her manager instead of reprimanding him. And the cherry on top, since I was full time and I quit of my own accord, I should have gotten a final paycheck paying out my accumulated vacation time, but my manager screwed me out of that too. All of the managers in the Tampa area just get away with whatever they want to without consequence and they fully know that. For the love of God, work anywhere else.","1.0

District managers for my location were hired externally and did not know the first thing about what day-to-day operations at the store level were like. Incredibly cold and rude during store visits. -There is also no clear review structure or any kind of incentives to back up goals which leads to low motivation and very high turnover. I was a key holder and was assigned tasks far beyond my job description (I basically did everything an assistant manager does without the benefits), yet it took a state law that was passed to increase minimum wage for me to get any kind of raise in nearly two years. We went through at least ten part timers and two store managers within my time there and there were numerous occasions where hours got cut due to lack of payroll. -Inventory management was atrocious; we were either way overstocked or severely understocked and never with items that were in demand from our customers. I went into a store recently and saw shoes on clearance that were there when I first started in 2015. I am not surprised that the company had to file for bankruptcy protection and closed hundreds of stores; they got far too expansion-happy and don't care about actually retaining current stores/employees.","1.0

Not allowed over time pay if you happen to work over 45 hours as a store leader. Only care about customers they do not care about the associate who work Excessively. Not rewarded for anything good you do. Group leaders/ district leaders pick at any small issue and make it bigger than it has to be. You have no life seriously. Anything good you do is over shadowed by any mistake or something you forgot! Not allowed to take off on Fridays which is unrealistic because sometimes things happen. Expect you to work the days consistently to what it says for requirements as if you are a robot. Expect you to complete things in short periods of time that my take longer than the allocated time frame. DL/GL do not listen. You cannot have an opinion, if you do be prepared to be shut down. Be prepared to be written and and your job dangled in your face. Don’t try to call corporate if you have issues with anyone. They don’t care either. Best thing to do is find another job because no matter what you say or do doesn’t matter at all. If you work for this company be prepared to work like a dog and don’t complain about anything.","2.0

I think complaining about any Company is worthless unless it's yours or you take the proper steps to talk to the proper people with your opinion of a new idea. A complaint solves nothing it just creates negative vibes. Bring something to the table and keep spirits up. It changes things for the best.","Nothing to say really. You learn when you choose to work somewhere, it's there ballgame. It is your choice to except employment. Ask more questions in the interview and become more informed.","5.0

The only thing I liked was doing the paperwork, and the ship to store.","Measuring kids nasty, dirty, smelly feet was disgusting. I had to put so much pressure on people to buy shoes and other accessories. There's personal, store, and district sales goals for the day, week, and month. If you don't meet the goals then you get in trouble. You get on an action plan that you have to complete. Every person that walks in and out gets counted, so you have to sell to them. Or at least get their email. Most customers complain that the prices are too high, and they can get this or that cheaper somewhere else. My manager would to anything to meet the goals. On the conference calls they would call you out and ask why you didn't make goals.","3.0
