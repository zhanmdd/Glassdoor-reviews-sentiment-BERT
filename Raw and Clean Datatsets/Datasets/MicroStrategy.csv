Very intelligent, kind, and interesting people to work with. It's easy to make friendships here","The company does not care about its employees. The corona virus crisis highlighted this more than ever. When every other tech company in the area and the country was encouraging their employees to telework, MicroStrategy kept insisting everyone should be in the office unless they have an ""extreme emergency"". None of their emails ever stressed that the company was concerned about their workforce, they only mentioned how important the customers are. Furthermore, the CEO's personal email to the company was one of the most unempathetic things I've ever read. He spoke about the crisis in terms of statistics, saying that we shouldn't worry because there are much worse diseases out there. The icing on the cake: he essentially wrote ""some people will die but they're old so its okay, we really need to worry about the economy"". It really shows how disconnected he is from normal working people. My advice? If you end up here get what experience you can in the first two years then go elsewhere that actually thinks of its workforce like people and not numbers to their bottom line","2.0

This is a lot of employees first job out of college, so definitely a more ""youthful"" feel in the department. You'll bond and become friends in the communal suffering. You can tell the immediate management cares to some degree, but they have absolutely no power to change anything. The offices & free food were nice.","Oooooh boy here we go. You'll be trained to support a product that is quickly becoming antiquated in the BI industry. You know what I love regarding installing an enterprise level business intelligence platform in the year 2020? Manually editing multiple text configuration and XML files. Or the UI on our Developer tool still stuck in the 90s. It's becoming increasingly complex to manage as a platform, and most companies are moving to newer and sleeker options. I hope you have a good hat rack with many hooks, because you'll acquire quite a collection. Previously, the department was separated by product specialty. Makes since, right? It's such a complex product, and takes a new engineer anywhere from 1-1.5 years to really become familiar with supporting it. Now, you'll be expected to support every aspect of the product. Jack of all trades, master of none. On top of that, they got rid of the Technical Account Managers, so you'll have the awesome option of taking on those responsibilities for no extra pay. Oh, expect to be asked to work late supporting some big important escalation. Yes, we have teams in Europe and Asia who could support their hours better. But that's okay. Also, we have 24x7 support on weekends, so expect a weekend or two a quarter of being on call the entire time. Yes, even at 4am. Also, I hope you enjoy being forced to not only be on call with all of our customers, but also share your webcam with them! Don't mind that people in IT support tend to be introverts or not want to be in the spotlight. Or the eventual sexual harassment incidents that will occur to any of the few remaining female employees. We used to have neat team events, those got axed long ago. Free food once a week usually was nice pre-COVID. Your compensation will be ""meh"" at best for a new college grad, and will only get worse. The engineers who choose to stay at MicroStrategy stay because of the people and the work culture. The people are mostly gone, and the culture has been burnt to the ground by executive management who swear they know best. The small quarterly bonus you do get (which is subject to company performance, so not too optimistic on that) is pitiful and doesn't scale with your salary, if you're lucky enough to see a raise. Also, they used to give yearly COL raises of like 2%, but that went out the door. Mike must need a new yacht (no, seriously).","1.0

The new senior sales leadership doesn't seem to understand the human aspect of leadership. You can't pull comp and expect that to motivate your sales staff to focus on the one remaining item you comp. Instead, it motivates us to find a new company to work for. Initiatives and comp plans are also completely misaligned. Major pushes for sales this year are getting all customers upgraded to the latest software version and moving the majority to the cloud. Guess what sales doesn't get compensated on? That's right, cloud and upgrades (among many other things). Additionally, sales management is putting a lot of pressure on us to boost our pipeline numbers to unrealistic heights. The reality is, people are artificially boosting numbers in an attempt to make things look good but the real prospects don't look promising.","2.0

You have to be self-motivated and willing to teach yourself. You can form an internal network to assist with any issues, but for the most part it will be referencing documentation and tech notes to be up to date with customer issues. 2. You have to enjoy challenges. You will face a lot and have to be willing to problem solve like your life depends on it. 3. You get out what you put into it. If you put in minimal effort, customers won't have nice things to say and you won't be recommended to work with them again. If you put in the effort to learn and meet customer expectations, you'll do fine. 4. DEFINITELY expect travel especially at the beginning. Once you're established, it's easier to find remote work (if that's what you want) and customers that are okay with it. You'll still have to travel every once in a while, but not nearly as often. This also really depends on the customer. I went from traveling about 50% of the time to about 10% or where the customer gave me the choice to travel or work remote. I absolutely love my job, but I'm also someone who loves challenges and doesn't like to be bored.","It's consulting, which means everything comes down to how much revenue you bring in. You don't usually get to choose the projects you're on, which means you don't really get to choose how much money you bring in, which means your rating doesn't always seem fair. With that being said: being proactive and helping internally when there is not a lot of billable work is important and can make up for less time working with customers.","4.0

Mon Mar 02 2020 07:47:51 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Senior Director,"Remote, OR",Former Employee ,Trouble in the Tower,I worked at MicroStrategy full-time for more than 8 years,"MicroStrategy is a well known brand with multiple offices located around the world, providing an international flavor depending on your role. There are some very good, bright people at the company, however, the best and brightest are generally the quickest to look for the exits. The company will test your ability to endure pain and suffering in your career, providing a great opportunity to learn a lot about yourself in the process. The company offers above average benefits and has a 401k match program, however, there are no RSU's or ESPP. Compensation in the US and in select international locations is generally fair.","This is an incredibly dysfunctional company that is run by an autocratic leader, surrounded by a C-Suite that has been hired to re-affirm him, not to challenge him. As a result, the company is replete with cliques, heavy-handed top-down management decisions, and political gamesmanship that operates within a fear-based culture of conformity. Employee reviews are subjective and ratings given to direct reports are typically lowered by upper management overruling middle management decisions. Middle managers have no real power to make decisions for their teams with all decisions resting upon the final approval of MJS, who is often manipulated by his direct C-Level reports. The company has been losing market share and stays in business because of customer renewals and the CEO's billions. Very few net-new licenses are ever sold and they are not competing well against other leading players in the BI space. The poor showings in the Gartner Magic Quadrants is justified internally by saying Gartner has changed their methodology rather than acknowledging product shortcomings and closing those gaps. MicroStrategy does not offer stock options (RSU's or ESPP) and doesn't offer anything to build long term employee loyalty. The fastest way to a raise or a promotion is to either threaten to leave or to actually leave and then return to MicroStrategy -- there are many boomerangs who have negotiated better opportunities for themselves by going this route.","1.0

Also, the upper management has no idea how our product works. They change the feature spec according to their personal preference.

All middle managers are 'yes man', and the order is always top-to-bottom. They pretend they ""listen"", but once you get a bad manager you are out. Beware that there is no 2 way communication - which is very sad since if they listen to what majority people think and reflect on their planning it might be beneficial. Also I know people who still work there always prepare for a job interview since you never know when they are going to let you go without any notice and I mean even your manager won't know that you are gone. In general I noticed that the culture was very toxic - people have to be in ""the same line"" as your manager or higher up so they can watch your back kind of thing. God forbid you actually put in honest 8 hour hard work with result and leave to have a life outside of the company.

I foresee the company experiencing more challenges as current customers leave to implement more flexible well-rounded solutions that are native to the cloud, and, are likely cheaper as well. - From a Gartner Magic Quadrant perspective, hard to see MicroStrategy maintaining challenger status. As more customers leave, I would predict niche player status sooner rather than later. Not being a native cloud based solution will continue to hold them back and because IT involvement is so necessary in implementation, it's tough to envision anything but a decline from Gartner in the future. - Financials are weak. Publicly traded so all information is available and would highly recommend reviewing.... Income statement should strike concern in any sound investor. Revenue and gross income down year over year at a steady pace since 2015 (maybe even longer). Net cashflow trends are even worse… Leadership: -Revolving door lol Personal Experience: - Reported to a VP who was difficult to work with. - Much of management was difficult to work with, I suspect because they struggled to understand the priorities of the day, week, month, etc. because of the lack of strong institutional guidance. - I'd describe the environment as ""just trying to keep the ship from sinking"" at all times. How it ended: - Left a really good job for an opportunity at MicroStrategy to help with quite a few process changes and upgrades. Once everything was seemingly completed and a lot of the painpoints were resolved, was laid off without any warning. My only guess to why... light revenues were being seen yet again, and leadership had to cut costs to try to save on revenue margins???? Or they just wanted an extra set of hands to help with some short term issues they were dealing with, and once everything was good then there was no need for me any longer. Either way, tough way to treat employees Long Story Short: - Use caution or avoid completely. - Not worth the risk and better off where you are now or continue searching for a stronger company","1.0

Tue Oct 29 2019 11:01:19 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,Good place to start but not to stay,I have been working at MicroStrategy full-time for more than 3 years,"The pros are in the people and the location. There are some very intelligent and kind people at the company. Everyone always seems to have a good attitude and are willing to help each other out. For a first job out of college, it is great. The starting pay is alright (albeit a little under the market rate), you develop some strong skills, and the culture is fun. The work life balance is fairly good too. Aside from some tension close to releases, work generally stays in the office and people's lives aren't heavily impacted outside of work hours. Beyond that the office is great. A gym on location, a lounge with plenty of free coffee and other drinks, and the office is located right next to the best mall in the entire DMV area. There's a good holiday party too.","The cons amount to so much more than the pros. While lower and middle management are amazing the upper management is a constant headache. There is a blatant divide between the upper management and the rest of company. Far too often, upper management blatantly ignores what workers are asking for. When 80% of employee responses in a public survey asked for more remote work opportunities, the management ignored this and instead addressed a request for ice cream that was clearly a joke response. It felt like such a slap in the face to not even have our complaints acknowledged and to be given ice cream as if we're children. Upper management's decisions are all over the place. The ""company direction"" is always getting rerouted and projects that have been significantly developed are suddenly scrapped when the upper management decides to develop something else. There's an environment of fear where a lot of decisions made at a lower level are just to please the CTO and, especially, the CEO even when they don't make sense from the perspective of engineering and product quality. Furthermore, upper management is constantly too ambitious and expects far too much to be developed for the amount of people the company has. There are regularly last minute changes in scope and patches being rolled out because everything that was demanded was unachievable from the beginning. Product quality ends up suffering and key issues get patched over without being truly fixed. The company does not do nearly enough for retaining quality employees. I can't imagine what went through management's heads when they decided to make a huge hiring push AND gave all the new hires large increases in their starting salaries. Now we're losing experienced engineers because there isn't enough money to go around for the raises and promotions they deserve. Some people who have multiple years of experience under their belt are making barely a few thousand over the fresh college hires. This has created a high turnover among junior employees that seems to be getting worse and worse every year. Engineers with the most potential quickly jump ship for a company that pays them what they should earn. Lastly, I have to mention that recruitment straight up LIES to candidates. They advertise that new engineers will get to choose their teams, will always receive the full quarterly bonus, and will receive automatic promotions. All of this is untrue. The financial incentives change every quarter and even the standard 1 year promotions aren't guaranteed. Everyone is assigned to teams regardless of their preferences as well. I'm not sure if this is a disconnect between recruiting and management but it needs to stop as it quickly sours new employees once they realize they've been lied to and drives the high turnover rate of younger employees that I mentioned earlier. Like I said, this is a good first job out of college but that's it. I would not grow a career here based on how the management is performing.","2.0

This trickles down from management and creates an atmosphere of general lack of kindness. This is a company where only heroes are celebrated. You must prove your mettle by showing up early, staying late, coming in on weekends, and above all else *making sure you are seen and heard doing that.* Several months ago it was mandated that EVERY SINGLE Technology give up their entire weekend (shortly before the holidays) even if there was no pending work to be done by you/your team. The understanding was -- just come in , and make sure you are seen by someone by senior management. Only SuperStars are celebrated here, not Rock Stars -- the ones that fly under the radar but consistently get their job done, day in and day out. I will take a less visionary or pivotal software company where people treat each other kindly any day over a company like MSTR which, while having admittedly excellent Technology, has an internally dysfunctional and toxic work culture.","2.0

Coworkers - people here are friendly, smart and driven 2. Gym in the building 3. Good holiday party","1. EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP - “Yes men” who are all afraid to push back on the CEO, changing priorities with little to no explanation, not inspiring at all whatsoever (besides perhaps the CIO - she’s great). 2. COMPENSATION - pay is far below the market rate and with the amount of layoffs we’ve been having don’t expect any significant raises 3. TOXIC CULTURE - the CEO breeds a culture of fear, everything trickles down from the top and his behavior is contagious. He can be very rude and condescending and will call people out directly on Slack. He’s incredibly intelligent, but doesn’t set the best example. I’ve witnessed CXOs throw each other under the bus just to stay on the CEOs good side. 4. ATTRITION/WAVES OF LAYOFFS - be prepared to see people leave. Very high attrition here. Also, every three years they do a massive round of layoffs. 5. POOR CODING STANDARDS - if you’re looking at applying to the Tech department be aware that the software is behind the times, the coding standards are sub par at best. Most of the Tech leadership team as zero technical background so you’ll be taking direction from someone who doesn’t know anything about coding At the end of the day, if you want to work in Tech in DC, you have WAY better options than MicroStrategy. Amazon’s starting salaries are $20k-$30k more than MicroStrategy and they have a much better reputation. There’s also a ton of cool new startups in the city that are worth exploring.","1.0

Lets start with the most important aspect for anyone in business development – commission. The commission plan is fluid to put it kindly. You can have absolutely no confidence in the commission plan as it changes non stop, this could be due to the constant changes in senior management however the fact that it seems to change whenever there is potentially some large commission to pay out due to deals about to come in has led me to believe its something more planned and sinister. I have come to the firm conclusion that there is somebody in the CFO office who is actively instructing the sales department to adjust the commission plan accordingly in order to minimise commission paid. This would be in line with the general drive to minimise costs in the last 12 months. The company has been boasting about recruitment numbers etc, however this hides the fact that new recruits seem to be coming in on minimal salary while a lot of the higher earners in senior management appear to have been shown the exit. With the constant drive to minimise commission and the clear message of driving down costs it does lead one to wonder if the company is in worse shape than they are stating in there financial reporting (which wouldn’t be the first time!) Next up I will touch on the culture / atmosphere at work. To be completely frank it appears to be little more than a cult worshipping the CEO / Chairman of the Board / President -(all the same person by the way lol). Any senior management who dare disagree with anything the great leader says doesn't last long. Which obviously leads to yes men all through the chain of command. I can honestly say I have not had one manager who I actually respected in terms of how they do their job. Everyone lives in fear of the great leader and this obviously permeates every aspect of working their, to the extent that as part of their reviews they have everyone anonymously rate others performance, which is obviously used to settle scores. Anyone familiar with the tactics of the great cultural revolution? Is that's your thing then MSTR (Microstrategy) is the place for you! . Anyway I have better things to be doing than spending time on this company, I would just urge any BDR looking to join MSTR to avoid this company. You will not get the commission you are promised and the fact that they are actively minimising the commission they are paying may point to something far more serious in terms of their future viability. Finally, it is quite amusing to see all the poorly written, short, positive reviews with no likes. If i didn't know better I would have to question whether they were genuine...

They all have new initiatives they would like to run. - A lot of new upper management hires. I'm not saying those hires are bad, but with every new VP, they are bringing their own style and trying to make their own mark. This brings a lot of change and constant new initiatives or how to do things down to the foot soldiers. - Communication and Organization confusion. This is on 2 levels. 1. As a BDR we are classified as ""marketing"" that's confusing because the sales team says you work for them. When marketing wants you to run a campaign, you would then have to run it by your sales team to see if that is okay. Vice Versa. 2. Campaigns, messaging and events. Campaigns - When we run a campaign, often times the sales team does not want us to run them. If the campaign is for us to call people that attended an event, we need to check with the sales team to see if they want us to call them. Messaging - the messaging we have for these campaigns are often provided by the BD and Marketing teams. The sales team changes it and gives us something completely different to use which we will have to justify to our BD managers. Events - We were at an event and the training on how to man the booths happened... during our first shift of manning the booth. Luckily the booths are fairly self explanatory but a little planning would have solved this issue. Can you imagine a 3 week BD rep fresh out of college with a psychology degree trying to talk to software architects about federated analytics and data pools vs data silos.","4.0

Mon Apr 29 2019 17:26:02 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,Incredibly poor management,I have been working at MicroStrategy full-time for more than 3 years,"Good starting salary. Good location. It's a good job if you're starting out. Your co-workers are going to be very smart, friendly, helpful and kind, with no backstabbing competitiveness. I must admit, it's easy to take this for granted from time to time.","The cons are mostly about the management, so I'm going to divide my criticism into 3 parts: direct manager, his manager, and company management/direction. 1. Direct Manager: Extremely inexperienced as a manager. He will always rush you to ""fix defects"" as soon as possible. Direct managers are not technical at all and will have absolutely no interest in writing good code, dealing with tech debt, understanding the technical challenges of whatever you're working on, etc. They are apparently measured just on the number of defects, so that's what he is focused on at all times. He has an extremely negative presence, and the team feels it. He will make up arbitrary deadlines (often tells the team things like ""upper management has asked for this"", which no other team can corroborate) and convince you to stay till 7 or 8 pm to work, and, funnily enough, he would leave at 5. Feedback during one-on-ones is non-existent. He would say that he doesn't decide the score out of 5 that we get (he says everyone got a 3, literally every time), or our bonus, or our review, or our raises. When asked how to improve, I have heard the same thing every quarter: do more of what you're doing, which isn't very specific or helpful. It does not seem like he is accountable to anyone for how unprofessionally he handles reviews. He has also forbidden us from spending time during work learning things, which, for software engineers, is incredibly stifling and uninspiring. All in all, possibly the worst manager you can have. Furthermore, there isn't a proper channel to voice my concerns, so there's not much I can do here. 2. His manager: Usually managers in this position are people who have worked at Microstrategy for more than 10 years. So they are very used to how things are done and are very averse to changes in technologies or updates. There is an incredible amount of red tape if you want to voice your ideas, which is why hackathons are such a big deal. It's the only time when employees can work on projects that they think are cool. Some of the best ideas recently have through hackathons. However, senior managers seem to not be interested in those at all in the last couple of years. As such, it's a dull environment intellectually. You will rarely even get to speak to him (might be specific to this particular manager), and he will not know your name or what you're working on. Also, your raises will be less than inflation, which is really disappointing, but not unexpected since he wouldn't even know your name. 3. Upper management ends up deciding everything about the technical direction of the product. Directions change drastically and we are constantly scrambling from one area of focus to another, with no transparency or good communication. Managers get the most visibility and often micromanage about which features or new things we should be working on. We have a number of core values: transparent, agile, precise, cheerful and engaged. Microstrategy technology department fails on all of them.","1.0

Sun Apr 14 2019 11:52:49 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Former Employee ,Don't ever get comfortable,I worked at MicroStrategy full-time,"Company pays well and has a great benefits package. Overall the company tends to hire smart, qualified staff and does show interest in helping them grow. MicroStrategy is a company you can grow in IF you are beloved by senior management and the executive team.","MicroStrategy continues to perform their annual practice of laying off employees with zero advanced notice and a laughable severance package. The CFO starts the year off bragging about how the company has grown by nearly 800 employees and that the financial outlook of the company is so strong that they took advantage of their high performance to buyback some of the companies stock. Not even a month later layoffs begin happening across the company. Including departments that backfilled positions or were even given permission to grow in order to perform better as the company grew. If you look at the history of many of the employees at MicroStrategy you will notice gaps of tenure, former employees returning to the company after being denied a promotion to only be given it after returning, and favorite employees being placed in positions that they are wholly unqualified for. MicroStrategy is a company who spends more time taking care of its executive floor and making sure that their whims are taken care of over ensuring that the business is healthy, profitable, and that its' ""most important asset, you, the employee"" are being addressed. The executive team all have their yes-men that they listen to while ignoring anyone else who might be bringing up information that needs to be shared but doesn't want to be heard. Seeing the history of this company in the press, the direction the industry is moving, and the way this company carries itself in how it conducts business; I would strongly recommend that you look elsewhere for future employment and that current employees keep their resumes well polished and nearby because you never know when you will get that ominous meeting invite in your mailbox.","1.0

The list is extremely long. Will highlight just a few. - If u planning to join the technology department, absolutely do not join! The head of the department is a CTO who has zero technical knowledge and is very hard to have a conversation with. When he speaks in town halls, everyone usually finds it a good time to take a nap. - Not just the CTO, all VPs reporting to the CTO are also non technical. If that was not enough, u wll not be reporting to an engineering manager but a product owner i.e. another non-technical person. The hierarchy is absolutely crazy. Just imagine as a software engineer, your bonus, promotion etc. depends on hierarchy of product owners, VPs, CTO that do not understnd a single line of code. They will still go ahead and give you a rating based on how they like you. U have to have a brown nose to get any bonus or promtion i.e. u have to lose all ur self respect. - Everyone you talk to is unhappy and is usually are staying at this company because they are either visa dependent or family reasons. That is it. No single employee in technology really wants to be here. This place really has the worst culture I have ever seen. - Above all, quality of release product is so so bad that as a software engineer, I do not want to mention outside that I was part of any product releases here.","1.0

Yes, there are some very smart and good people here but most EVERYONE is unhappy, tired, overworked and under appreciated and it shows in the toxic, negative environment that you will walk into every single day during your time here. There are no growth opportunities, no recognition for the hard work you will put in, no care for you as an individual or as a human being. One of the biggest frustrations was constantly dealing with VPs dropping the ball and pointing the finger at someone below them - whether it was directed towards me or someone else, it's completely unacceptable and it happened all too often across many of the teams. That is just not a healthy or productive work environment. The pay is well below market averages and they will sell you on pay raises and bonuses but make no mistake, it is a lie. The HR department is some masters of trickery. I've witnessed people go through harassment from executives and be disregarded. I've seen upper management make it a personal mission to get rid of those they didn't ""like"" and push them out. Just all in all, do yourself a favor and run. This place has the reputation it does for a reason and I really wishes I hadn't ignored the warnings before joining.","1.0

Related to BDR position: - Limited and ineffective training - BD management is woefully undertrained, inexperienced, undersupervised, and inefficient - Stale, outdated, and unrealistic metric goals for NA considering expansion of department - Inconsistent expectations by management - Inconsistent advice given to BDR's by management - Inconsistent enforcement of rules - The company values of ""engaged"" , ""transparent"", and ""cheerful"" are all laughably absent from BD leadership. - tant revolving door. BDR’s are ""asked to leave"" frequently and continuously, often times for reasons outside of their control. Some BDR's are given enough time to find another job. Others are ruthlessly fired on the spot, with no warning, and with no given reason. - Repetitive and unfulfilling job tasks - Management likes to hire new BDR’s as contractors, so they can be fired with minimal paperwork - As a contractor, you get no benefits. - The real training is done by failing at your job, talking to your outside sales team, and talking to other co-workers who were trained at other companies - Data in the CRM tool is manipulated by BDR's and ignored or promoted by management to boost artificial BD numbers for the department to make BD management look competent. - Meeting writeup process is illogical and non-productive - BDR's are setup for failure in most circumstances, and every day you fight to keep your job. There is no such thing as job security here. You feel like a hamster on a wheel working here. - Toxic BD management: unprofessional behavior and treats employees poorly. Includes name calling, cursing, negative intimidation, anti-social behavior, and unethical practices - Anti-social behavior and unethical practices by management are notoriously well known among BDR’s but no action is taken and no one speaks up due to fear of repercussions - Quarterly reviews of management are not accurately rated due to fear of someone in HR or BD management finding out who wrote it, and fear of repercussions. - Management has decided that fear and intimidation are the best way to rule and dominate over their BDR minions. This is a big misstep for these BD overlords, and truly a very faulty way to run a department and to treat anyone. In return, the BDR team has no respect for management. This doesn't incite positivity which is desperately needed for a position like this where so much rejection and negativity already exists without management amplifying it. Management routinely finds new and innovative ways to crush BD team comradery. I wrote this review primarily to warn those looking at this position. Like most jobs, it's oversold to you, but you may not realize the type of negative and degrading atmosphere you'll be stepping into once you're hired. There are much better companies in the DC area who will train you and treat you right. Commission here is only 1/3rd of what was offered only a few years ago. This company tries everything it can to avoid paying out commission, your base pay is mostly what you'll get. Management here is very shallow. By far these have been the worst bosses I've had the dissatisfaction to work for. I have nothing bad to say about any of my other bosses at other jobs, they were always seen by me as good people trying their best and helping you to do your job well. The bosses I've had here are nothing like the one's I've had in the past. Completely toxic. Avoid.","1.0

It can be soul destroying getting a constant stream of ""no's"" day after day as you chase key accounts. But the thing that keeps you coming back for more is the potential to make money when those ""no's"" become ""yes's"". Breaking into new accounts can take months / years of research/ preparing the right message/ calling / emailing etc but again it is worth it as you are chasing your comp once the deal lands. The number 1 problem for BDR's at Microstrategy is that you can have no faith in the comp plan. It seems to change on an almost quarterly basis -if I was cycnical, and I am -I would suggest the changes in comp plan directly correlate to how much money MSTR have to pay out in a given quarter based on expected deals closing. It appears that MSTR will do anything to limit the amount of bonus paid to BDR's, as well as treating them with disrespect and with borderline contempt. I won't even bother going into the politics of the place or ever changing senior management with their constantly changing focus as if to justify their positions. My only goal to write a review here is to warn potential BDR's to think twice before taking a role here as you WILL NOT make the expected commission","1.0

It was a learning experience on a personal and professional level. The gym at HQ and the wellness programs are awesome.,"Employee review/evaluation system: This was the #1 absurdity. As at least one other review mentioned, employees are rated on a scale of 1 (worst) through 5 (best). My boss let me in on the fact that team leaders were limited as to how many 5s (if any) they were allowed to dole out in a given quarter. Obviously, this is designed such that no one can achieve their 100% merit bonus! As someone who is accustomed to being a rockstar at her job, I felt slighted whenever I didn't receive the shiny 5 stars. In my first review, I was demerited as a result of not being exposed to enough of my job responsibilities up to that point in time -- and this was actually acknowledged to be of no fault of mine. In later reviews, my demerits were due to comparison to the team - my peers had already been placed in charge of larger projects prior to my hiring (and were unwilling to share much of the workload), so they received singing accolades, whereas I was left in the dust. My abilities were never factored in. Onboarding literally did not exist: As a new hire, I was given nothing to do for months. I actually decided to work as a contractor for another company in my spare time after my requisite 8 hours in the office, just so that I wouldn't feel depressed about how under-utilized I was. I would have resigned sooner (along with the other new hire in my group) if I hadn't made a promise to myself to give it a full year. New ideas unwelcome: When I was finally given tasks, I was kept on a short leash. I tried but was usually shot down when trying to introduce efficiencies and new ideas. I was kept at a distance and often out out of the loop. Too many cooks in the kitchen that were all very set in their ways. How could I be expected to be a shiny 5-star employee with roadblocks everywhere I turned? Management: Unapproachable. My boss never gained trust in my abilities because she simply chose not to interact with anyone besides her favorite employees (of which I was certainly not), except on a weekly or when absolutely needed basis. I have never worked for or with anyone so unapproachable. Negative atmosphere: While the rest of the team was mostly friendly, the overall atmosphere was unpleasant and constantly stressed. Even the friendly ones were like an old club that would head out to happy hour and exclude me regularly. I like a fast-paced demanding role, but I could do without the negativity that is clearly rewarded at MSTR. Inflexibility: While some team members were allowed to work remotely 100% of the time and others dabbled with it frequently, I was actually denied a request to work remotely for 1 day (not even PTO), which resulted in my missing an event that I'd hoped to attend. The reason given was the desire to have a minimum number of folks from the team in the office on that day - a mid-quarter Friday during which I was, as usual, underutilized. Moreover, nothing about the job responsibilities requires presence in office. As for PTO, 15 days at a manager level is pretty weak. One of my teammates was constantly being hassled for the sometimes flexible hours she chose to work (while the work was getting done, and in her role there was no logical reason that she needed to be working within a rigid window). My philosophy simply did not align; I think flexibility should be rewarded where the work is getting done and the focus should be on the work product rather than ""hours clocked"".","1.0

So why did the anger burst so fiercely in recent 3 years after the re-organization? I don’t want to repeat the negative reviews on glassdoor. I personally agreed with some reviews and disagreed with the rest. I laughed when reading some of the hilarious reviews, I could tell many reviews were written with rage. In my mind, this was mostly because the person left that review could not adapt to change. The old MicroStrategy had built a culture that strongly bonded employees, so once some senior leadership got changed 3 years ago; it also propagated to the entry-mid level, voluntarily: as some people work for people, not for company. And the change might have emotionally affected them that let them choose to leave voluntarily. I don’t want to comment about which senior leadership is better, the old or the new, as I have not directly worked with either of them. But what I could tell was that many senior leadership are trying to save the company by doing what they could right now. So yes, there is still some chaos within the company as it tries to pivot itself, and it could get people feel frustrated some times.","4.0

It can be fun and exciting at times, especially if you are establishing yourself. To thrive here, you must be extremely flexible and roll with the punches and you need a sense of humor. MicroStrategy typically hires great junior and mid-level people. The benefits are good, but could be better (3 weeks vacation to start; max at 5 weeks), 50% 401k match, fun HR activities, employee lounge with nice coffee, beautiful onsite gym with free classes).","Strategy is led solely by the CEO and he believes he knows everything about everything. This means department heads who should be experts in their field typically become ""yes men"". The department heads typically bring mid-level employees into CEO reviews and don't typically offer much support or air cover which is extremely frustrating. There is a big focus on ""field empowerment"", but it seems like lip service right now. There isn't a lot of diversity or women in positions higher than a Director which is a problem as well.

Mon Nov 06 2017 21:08:24 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Engineer,"Tyson's Corner, Fairfax, VA",Former Employee ,Stack ranking is a poison,I worked at MicroStrategy full-time for less than a year,"* Great enterprise BI softwares * Great location of the HQ building * Decent pay and benefits * Food truck and Thirsty Thursday in summer * Quarterly performance review allows for quick feedback from the management, which is helpful for improving performance and expectation.","I was quite surprised that MicroStrategy still uses the stack/forced ranking approach to review its employees that had been proven a failed system for performance evaluation by Yahoo, Microsoft, etc a few years ago. During the quarterly performance review process, managers use a number between 1 - 5 to rate the employees (1 being the worst and 5 the best), and they curve the performance ratings within each team, meaning that a small fraction of the team members get a 1 or 2, and smaller fraction get 4 or 5, while the majority get a passing score of 3. Almost all of us consider the following to be equivalent: 1 = F, 2 = D, 3 = B, 4 = B+, 5 = A Even if you are a new hire, your performance is reviewed without lenience. To be honest, I got a low rating three months after I joined the company. Never had I got a such low performance rating in my entire career or school life till that point, I was totally frustrated. I tried my best to learn the new gig, and yet the manager considered that to be NOT good enough. I feel like MicroStrategy does not allow the new people to take time for learning, instead the manager expects new hires to hit the road and start running on day one, which is unrealistic expectation for people who come from a different field than BI. As a new hire, your first 3 - 4 weeks are spent 100% on the bootcamp, leaving only 8 - 9 weeks for actually learning/doing the work. My first perf review results made me question whether the company is good fit for me, so I made myself back on the job market. A few months later, I quit and landed on a bigger company that offers a better compensation package and probably a better career path, too.","4.0

Good work life balance, my managers are very comprehensive and caring about my growth and personal well being.","There is a quite hybrid version of Agile applied, I think that leave the SMs a little bit powerless. There is wrong agile rules being applied that biases the whole point of SM, like 1 point = 6 hours (the velocity will never change, there is always 40 hours in a week), so it is kind of impossible to get anything out of this data, to learn from it, have meaningful look at our productivity (like you are expecting from Agile). And this meaningless data is a key metric for the data driven management.. There is a true believe that being a data-driven with ""switches"" that you can turn up or down is the dream company... on the contrary, I personally don't believe it is possible to inspire people in the long term with the carrot and stick approach. We need to leave enough autonomy and trust to employee so they can do their best work. I do think the 20/80 program initiative is driving us in the right direction. The compensation is not what I would expect even though I do feel recognized. The promotion do not solve that problem much (little raise).

Also, employee lounge with pool table, if that sort of thing interests you. Flexible work hours. Working remotely is frowned upon, but building elevator is busiest around 10 pm and 5-6pm. Some minor but industry-average employee discounts at tech retailers like Apple and Dell. Ridiculously talented technology workforce in China and HQ. These are the architects, programmers and testers that pour countless hours into building company's products and reducing technical debt in the face of continuous cultural and organizational challenges, never-ending realignments of product strategy and a caustic work environment.","It is not at all surprising that this company with great potential has been marred by trouble after trouble in many directions. The now-infamous 2014 letter from Apex Capital to the CEO telling him to dock the yacht may have been spot-on but did not bode well for the rest of the company: Saylor came back with a vengeance and started micromanaging every nook and cranny of each product in the company's portfolio. This happens in many companies and the user that product management has to react to and satisfy is not only the customer but also the executive sponsors; but in the case of MSTR, these executives are a socially inept CEO that listens to noone but himself, a CTO that is even more socially inept than the CEO, with no technical acumen or leadership skills to speak of, and a string of yes-men (mostly men) from the CTO all the way down, that have time and again seen that the the key to survival in a company that did reorgs once a month at some point is never disagreeing with the CEO lest face, at best public humiliation over email, and at worst, termination. The company was run with no governance and internal accountability like an early stage start-up for many years and the efforts to rectify that were ham-handed at best. Paying a large sum for Agile Scrum management software, management tried to institute a time-recording system using that platform, raising the ire of many employees in the development ranks. Years and years of never having done real performance reviews and not having kept performance records, the company enabled senior director or VP-level people to directly grade hundreds of employees based on no feedback whatsoever from them or their supervisors; the effort to start performance management took off pretty much as a formality, where rankings and promotional considerations still continued to be based on factors other than real merit. When MSTR ventured into identity HR made colossal mistakes by stacking the senior management of that effort with non-technical product executives from security companies. And when all failed without a proper GtM strategy, they rebranded overnight into a security product, which finally fizzled out into an add-on feature for the BI suite. The bitterness from management mistakes and the executive rank's reactions to developments in a publicly-traded company results in very poor morale in the workforce and subsequently super-high attrition rates quarter after quarter. To HR's credit they tried every trick in the organizational behavior playbook: An employee council that tried to make employees feel empowered through anonymous surveys? Check. Super-high referral bonuses? Check. Happy hours? Check. Food truck free lunches instead of serving leftover food from the executive floor on other floors' kitchens? Check. But, the fact remains that most of the employee base is either looking for jobs elsewhere or scheming to rise. Another indicator of the poor health of the company is the vast divide between perceptions of success in different groups. Business Development or Engineering folks can be right in the middle of this misery (unless they are senior level folks that know how to play their cards right) while Legal or Marketing folks can be blissfully unaware of the fires going on among the development teams.","1.0

On your first day, you are given a 5$ voucher to use in the snack room (where no snacks are given for free btw...coffee and tea is pretty much it!) which is very 'cheap' especially for employees coming from other tech companies who are generous with all their employees. The top managers, on the other hand, have access to a VIP lounge where free multi-course meals, prepared by a chef, are served throughout the day. When it comes to business travel, you are even expected to pay for flights from your own pocket and then wait for reimbursement. Flights should be taken care of by the company travel agency, this is common practice in most tech companies, so employees don't have to incur too many costs while traveling regularly for business. The majority of employees in sales & marketing are critical and unhappy so it's a very demotivating environment. Don't expect to be in a typical high energy, fun tech environment. This might explain why employee turnaround is higher than average. There are so many inexperienced junior employees that believe and act as if they are super knowledgeable, yet agressive and insecure. It must be a matter of cost saving but majority of employees look like they are fresh out of college. The culture of gossip and 'mean girls' club is very obvious and should be dealt with.","2.0

I had a great team surrounding me, but the upper management made things impossible to change for the better.","MicroStrategy is and will always be a company dictated by poor leadership. The new CTO is a prime example of a disastrous leader and should not have been named CTO in the first place. MicroStrategy used to be filled with the top technology talent and recently most of them have ran out the door because of the CTO. You will never find him engaging with the technology teams on their floors, but rather sitting away locked in his office having meeting after meeting on how to fix things. The recruiting team tries to promise all of the college students a great place to come work and how great of an opportunity it is, but in reality you will be stuck in a cube and become just a number. College students beware of coming to work here. The CTO has no plan for you and everything is very disorganized. They promise you a rotational program, yet the new hires never get the chance to rotate. Your manager will probably change every few months, as the only people that stick around MicroStrategy are the ones that have been there forever and have the ""in"" with the CTO. If you don't mind a place where you have to suck up to the upper management and do as they say, then maybe this is the place for you. As a recent college grad, I was hoping to walk into a young, hip and fun office space. MicroStrategy is the farthest thing from that and you would never know they were technology company walking into the office. The walls are bare, there are cubicles everywhere, an an Usher system that goes offline everyday and as a programmer this office space is your worst nightmare. Just walk across the street to Capital Ones office to see what I am talking about.","2.0

The gym was nice, as was the easy access to the mall. Work/ life balance was good on my team, but that is not true company-wide.","If you are a recent grad/ early-career, stay far away. Many teams use old tech with bad code quality, and some products aren't unit tested at all. If you are lucky enough to be on a team using modern tech, expect to work long hours while upper management breathes down your neck. You will always be pushed to finish tasks as quickly as possible, even at the expense of code quality, documentation, and testing. Management needs to improve. Middle management only served to pass down orders from the top. Ideas from lower-level employees were often ignored and concerns were often dismissed out of hand. Everyone is expected to be a yes-man, and the culture is based in fear. I have seen managers yell and lash out at team members in anger. The review/ promotion/ raise process is incredibly biased and, frankly, illogical. Team members with different responsibilities and experience levels essentially fight for the same promotions, which fosters competition and discourages teamwork. Upper management will push lower-level managers to lower an employee's review score just to limit the number of good reviews in the team. It is also difficult to figure out how you need to improve in order to be considered for a raise, as there are no leveling charts or written job descriptions. Management loves to talk about how ""transparent"" they are, but that really couldn't be further from the truth. It was not unusual to come in to work to find that your team's responsibilities had completely changed overnight. Some might say that this is a by-product of how ""agile"" the company is, but I believe it is possible to be agile while still communicating effectively with your employees. The salaries are fairly competitive, but the other benefits could be better. The company is very proud of their Lynda usage, but Lynda is not a substitute for tuition reimbursement or conference attendance. Other perks like Food Truck Fridays and the pool table do not make up for everything else.","1.0

RUN FOR THE DOOR!,I worked at MicroStrategy full-time for less than a year,"Although, my time in the company was not pleasant to say the least, I must say that they had a really nice office and HQ. You get free gym access and there is a center for entertainment for breaks and such. The facility itself is really nice, and I loved being able to drive into work and not worrying about parking because the company had its own garage right next to Tysons mall.",": I don’t even know where to begin, I will be very polite in my post because I want everyone to know my experience here: Management: this is the reason why I left my job, essentially. Its either the managements way or the high way. Instead of giving you the tools to succeed, they will put you in positions to fail. A lot of times I would be given tasks to do that I didn’t have access to and expected to deliver. Management has no regard for your time, they schedule meetings and show up late or don’t show up at all without notifying their team. So if you slack once and not attend a meeting even though they haven’t meet for the last month it’s your fault. They will disregard the goals you had set for yourself in your reviews and give you complete different projects to fit their agenda even if you have no idea why you were placed on it. Communication is terrible, if you don’t ask, they won’t tell you any information in order for you to succeed. Expect to have 5 different managers telling you 5 different ways to do your job, resulting in a headache while you try to do your day to day tasks. Questions are not welcome, and put off by manager, they made it seem like every time I had a question I was bothering them. In case of an emergency at home or family don’t expect an email response from the managers, they only respond when it’s convenient for them. The problems here are just not normal. Company: the company in general is very confused on where its headed. The 6 months I have been there the CXO team and management was turned around twice, so it’s always fun when you have to report to a new boss every couple of months. The technology is pretty cool, a lot of smart individuals here. Don’t expect to work the normal hours, it’s an international company so it needs people to support international time zones. With that being said you don’t get to spend a lot of time with family even on the weekends. They expect you to get the work done and put everything second. CEO: i never worked in a place where the employees avoided their CEO or ran in fear when the CEO was headed their way. MJS walks around with a mean stern look in his face all the time, never acknowledges any one, and is very awkward to be around. He is incredibly smart don't get me wrong but has ZERO skills of a manager and not a people person at all. A lot of your team will not like working here so be prepared to deal with a lot of attitude. Not a very good working environment at all. Too much politics. Compensation is below the market for most positions, ESPECIALLY for the weird hours that people work to support the international team. We use our own security program to access to the building and parking garage and it doesn’t work most of the time, so get ready to get stuck in the elevator a few times and locked out of places. Be ready to work during most holidays. Pay is well below the market, a lot of low level employees put in and work a lot of crazy hours only to be paid trash salaries. Compared to top management that barely sell and get comped way more. People who sell don't know how to do anything, they make a lot of money and expects the analysts at HQ to do their job for them. Oh and the turn over rate is so so so high, people leave this company with in 3-6 months of starting, so don't plan on knowing any of your team mates long. you spend weeks and weeks training new candidates and they quit before they even finish training, what a waste of time.","1.0

Growing HR department IT is solid and super friendly Product is exciting to use Travel/Relocation opportunities With Sharepoint you have a great tool to learn every inch of the business Usher is a neat gadget to show off to friends,"I think it sucks that we have to do MicroStrategy training on our own time and they don't build it into the onboarding process or part of Employee Dev plans Another is some of The Establishment Mentality that needs to go Let me explain, so apparently there was some jazz in the company in 2014 revolving around Usher and layoffs and then another explosion over the start of these internal cadence calls. While most hated the cadence calls, it did provide a lot of transparency, improved efficiency and actually exposed a lot of people who could have used some improvement. I guess people didn't like their day to day progress out in the open and decided to leave. On sales calls I don't think AEs were fond of ""recent college grad"" analysts giving friendly suggestions about the successful trends they witnessed in the field. The dust at MicroStrategy has finally started to settle and honestly the company has been better since those individuals made their choice to move on. With the fresh talent we have coming in, new mid level leadership, and installation of the new corporate values. My advice to outsiders is to come through, bring your best and dive into the mix. It can get exhausting and frustrating but every time it's worth it and you'll grow and learn a lot. My advice to those here at MSTR is to keep the gears churning and keep being awesome people and the company will become what you and I both know It is capable of Long story short get your head out of the past.

Thu Nov 17 2016 16:12:13 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Tysons Corner, VA",Former Employee ,The problems here are NOT normal.,I worked at MicroStrategy full-time for more than a year,- Reasonably flexible PTO - Nice gym in the building - Good people at the team-level - Some strong friendships made through shared suffering,"Some other reviews on this site and some former colleges of mine have said essentially, “Sure, there are some problems here, but all workplaces have issue like this”. It is true, all companies have problems…but VERY FEW can possibly have as many as MicroStrategy. The biggest issue for me at MicroStrategy was the work environment. Pure and simple, the majority employees are not happy with their job there. There is a lack of motivation and passion for the work – almost no one has any interest in doing their job from day-to-day aside from appeasing their manager. This problem stems from a variety of causes, but in a large part is the aftermath of a massive round of layoffs in 2014. The company went from ~3500 employees worldwide to right around ~2000 over a year, many of these were laid off while the rest was due to subsequent attrition. A lot of the best people at the company abandoned ship during this period, leaving huge gaps in leadership and leading to numerous restructures. People talk openly about their job hunts and joke about who would be the last person left at the company. When I heard of friends leaving the company for other jobs, my disappointment at their departure was dwarfed by my excitement that they had been able to escape to somewhere better. There have been half-hearted attempts by management to improve the atmosphere, e.g. “Food Truck Fridays”, but the continued attrition and lack of real change has lead me to guess that they have concluded it is really not worth their effort to retain employees at this point. Benefits and compensation are less than competitive, as salary reviews will show. The majority of engineers are internationals on work visas, which is cheaper than paying competitive salaries to US software engineers. It feels like these international engineers are being taken advantage of – luckily many of them have moved on to places like Google and Facebook. The 401k plan is egregious. The company will half-match your 6% contribution (low compared to comparable companies) but read the fine print in the vesting timeline! A meager 20% vests after 2 full years there, and you have to be there for 6 YEARS for 100% vesting. Add to that that the plan is with Principal, a group notorious for high fees that eat away your retirement savings. Everything about the company of late feels like they are penny-pinching, from huge hassles submitting expense reports, to cancelling cell phone plans, to replacing forks and spoons in the kitchen with sporks (is this an elementary school cafeteria!?). Upper management is abysmal, as could be gathered from the CEO approval rating. No one has the courage to stand up to executives when they make terrible decisions, which is not surprising since most that have made a stand did not last long at the company. Many low-level managers are good people, but they are powerless to help their team advance their careers or protect them from nonsensical decisions and mandates from higher-ups. Good, hard workers are rewarded by piling more work on them. Your best chance at getting a raise or promotion is to say you are quitting (which, to be fair, seems to be pretty effective). On top of all this, the MicroStrategy product is profoundly flawed and is being outdone by competitors like Tableau at every turn. Keeping the product from becoming more and more obsolete every year takes the combined efforts of the entire technology department. The largest source of revenue is from support (this should say something about the quality of a product…) and from customers that have been invested for 10+ years that have put so much time and energy into maintaining the convoluted platform that they can’t bring themselves migrate to a better solution. It is truly a struggle to get excited about building and selling something that is just not very good. To anyone considering taking a job here, I’d strongly advise against it no matter the stage in your career. Look at rating trends and understand that many of the 5-star reviews are from current employees who were asked to write good reviews by management. To anyone currently working there, know that these problems are NOT normal and a workplace can be miles better. I’ve moved on and could not be happier to be at a different company. TL;DR – Work environment is miserable, management doesn’t care about employees, product is bad, don’t work here.","1.0

So, if you are reading this review because you are considering working at MSTR, the good news is you are NOT currently working at MSTR. Run, don't walk, away now. Ask any executive, recruiter, or placement professional in the Metro area about this place, and they will laugh and tell you to avoid like the plague. If you ARE currently working at MSTR, my condolences and good luck in your job search. Take some comfort in knowing you are learning exactly how NOT to run a company, treat employees, and earn respect. It will pay dividends in the future. As most reviews mention, the Tysons location and the on-site gym are the only real benefits of working at MSTR. Other than that, you will only find occasional glimmers of hope within the company. For example, you will find some talented staff, but they are slowly wasting away or leaving in droves.","The staff are mostly trying to do their best, but the problem is with the system. There are deep systemic management issues that are beyond repair. When leadership fails, the company fails. Saylor gets a lot of flack as CEO of the company, but he does deserve credit as a visionary and entrepreneur. His biggest mistake, next to Usher, was empowering Tim Lang as CTO, as the biggest issues are found within the Technology division. Decision making is not decentralized, and the CTO continues to show why he is not fit to lead. If you have ever taken any leadership classes, you will be astounded to learn the CTO fits NONE of the criteria that defines an effective leader. With all the charisma of a block of wet tofu, he has no ability to unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers. No one will follow this man into battle, as they have all learned that his commitment to quality and productivity are a scam, because he has no idea what is actually needed. He has never walked in the trenches or even met many of his own direct reports. He sets new strategy each quarter, never realizing that in an Agile environment, culture eats strategy for lunch. And Agile at MSTR is a complete joke! It was rolled out to staff without any training, company buy-in, or vetting of tools. Even the most basic principles, such as develop on cadence and release on demand are ignored. Leaders that are true developers of people are not valued and are quickly and barbarically terminated, only to be replaced by narrow and self-interested ""yes"" men. Knowing that your CTO has an enormous impact on your day-to-day quality of life at work, such as what projects you work on, recognition you receive, professional development, and bonus payout, the entire Technology department is hosed. For example, your quarterly bonus will not be based on performance, but rather the CTO's algorithm of the month. Supervisor input is completely ignored. The staffing breakdown at MSTR looks like this: 50% are actively searching for new jobs; 40% are held hostage by their H-1B status; 5% are complacent, and 5% are narcissistic senior managers that can't see past their own ego. That is why the churn is 10-15% per quarter, and you will never work on a stable team. Be sure to read the latest Gartner report on BI, and play close attention to the cautions listed. MSTR is dying a slow death, losing out to innovative, nimble companies such as Tableau. In 5 years, MSTR will be the next Britches Great Outdoor, Hechingers, or Woodward and Lothrops--all defunct Metro-area business that were once relevant. I could honestly go on forever in this section--withheld bonuses, public reprimands, blatant nepotism, and a thousand other negatives that make MSTR the laughing stock of the Metro area. Just ask the technology professional sitting next to you; they probably have an MSTR horror story of their own to tell. Go ahead, I will wait. See, I told you ;)","1.0

It upsets me a great deal that I agree with most of what the negative entries say as I did enjoy a decent amount of time at MicroStrategy. It's nothing short of tragic what has become of what was by most accounts an industry leader in BI. There are companies with bad executive management. There are companies with terrible executive management. Then there's MicroStrategy. There is one single person that makes every decision at this company. He's the judge, jury and executioner. To then provide the illusion of power to anyone else MicroStrategy has cut the front line and filled up the executive floor. You can't throw a rock on the 14th floor at headquarters without it hitting 7 different VPs of some obscure process. If by some miracle you don't hit a VP you'll hit a contracted worker there hired to do these recorded ""cadence calls"" ensuring that the sales team acts as directed.

If you are looking for a career in Sales, MicroStrategy is great place to be in a hot market.",There is certainly a lot of micromanagement in several ares of the business currently at MicroStrategy. Some of this is due to additional scrutiny on operational excellence and was necessary initially. The hope is that as the company continues to show additional profit growth some of the power will be handed back to the middle tier management layer.,"4.0

The immediate people you work with. Great bunch of highly intelligent, knowledgeable and dedicated individuals who’s talent is being squandered. A decent free gym in the same building with shower facilities and free classes. Next to Tyson’s corner mall.","I’d be skeptical of ALL recent positive reviews, I highly doubt they’re real/authentic and more of a marketing counter strategy to the actual honest reviews making the real truth come out. You think you’ll be rewarded for going that extra mile and putting MANY hours of overtime for a given project? Think again, you’ll just be reassigned and your credit for the previous project will be discarded. Adverse situations outside of your control WILL hurt you. Let’s say your manager changed three times within the course of a year to a year and a half. Come your annual review, the latest manager will NOT acknowledge all your work from previous years leading up to a much deserved promotion. Isn’t that a gem? Wipe the slate clean, throw all of your blood, sweat and tears for years out the door! So you see senior management get promoted and their titles change more than once within a business year. You think to yourself, hey, I’ll work my butt off to achieve that, nope, sorry no budget for you and in spite of performing above and beyond, it’s still not enough to qualify! Be prepared to be underpaid compared to industry standards. The irony is that if you applied for your same job as an external applicant you’d make more money and when asking to be compensated accordingly in terms of salary adjustment, you’ll always be given the runaround that you’re within the proper payment bracket. Fancy way of dodging the bullet. You CAN and WILL be screwed out of your bonus and promotions MULTIPLE times with claims such as ‘there’s no budget’ or ‘next quarter’ an then they turnaround and hire ten new people or say there was an outstanding quarter/year but never fulfill the bonus/promotion promises. Like a horse with a dangling carrot. Once? Twice? nope, it kept on happening over the years, UNACCEPTABLE! No wonder the company’s KEY talent that is the foundation of it’s success keeps going for exodus. Oh! Pray you never have a serious personal/family emergency in nearly 10 years and the first/only time you DO have to take time off because of it because it WILL be held against you and be told verbatim ‘it doesn’t matter why, you haven’t been here’. Support from your manger when a family member is critically ill to the point you break down in front of them? Forget it!

I switched teams twice, and there was no direction as to what the heck was happening/was going to happen. Soon enough, because of Usher, the worst access/security app ever, we got an announcement that the company was going to start laying off people to try to balance the losses from Usher. So for the last month I was there, I watched so many people either quit or get laid off. The atmosphere was AWFUL. Managers could care less about their employees. I heard stories that some higher level managers would take time off during the week their employees were getting laid off, not answering phone calls or emails, basically just hiding. Lots of people were laid off during their first week, after moving from various places to start this ""cool new job."" Honestly, I have to say I was relieved when I finally got the notice that I was to be laid off. Can't say I lost much because the only thing I really learned at MSTR was from my 6 weeks of training (funny thing is they laid off the majority of the training team too).

Great President's Club trips. Excellent pre-sales talent. Strong core analytics platform.,"I'm glad you asked. Where to begin? The worst part of a sales cycle at MicroStrategy is trying to get buy in from legal and finance. I expect this is partially why the company prefers to simply milk the customer base. There was essentially zero marketing support save for some roll of the dice on a once up and coming golf pro whose name no one remembers. The company's ""laser"" focus on analytics seems to be the problem in the eyes of the founder and CEO, so he works tirelessly to try and come up with the next version of sliced bread all the while sucking valuable resources from the core analytics platform. And the cycle just repeats. Upper management is deaf, likely the result of the CEO yelling at them. The massive layoffs compounded by more employees getting fed up and leaving means everyone is doing ""more with less"" making it difficult to get the support you need from the company to close business. The upside there is that you have a lot of independence... The whole thing is unfortunate. The product is very strong and the customer base is very loyal (indentured?). But management pokes customers in the ribs with sharp sticks on an annual basis. If you are a mercenary and could not care less about a career path or whether the company will do the right thing or simply disappear, etc. then MicroStrategy is a great fit for you. I made a lot of money for which I am very thankful, but view the investment I made in the company over 5 years as not delivering the return I had expected. It's more fun to make money and feel good about the company you work for.","2.0

I recently left MicroStrategy because the place is seriously messed up. I agree with all of the other reviews that depict Michael Saylor as a deranged megalomaniac who threw the company into chaos last year by firing twenty percent of its workforce. He then became perplexed as to why the company was not operating smoothly and efficiently and decided to insert himself into every single department of the company and demand to know why it was not operating at peak performance. He also fires anyone who disagrees with him. He is surrounded by terrified toadies and mealy mouthed minions. There is also some serious sexual misconduct going on in this company. The executives on the top floor are primarily short, ugly, middle aged men who like to hire and ogle young, sexy women who are not necessarily qualified for their jobs. They have a particular fetish for tiny Asian women. There are lots of ""sexy schoolgirl"" types. The executives openly flirt with these young women, date them, and give them special privileges. If you come to work here and you are an attractive young woman, you can expect sexual harassment of some kind. You will be summoned to the top floor to eat with the executives, ""be nice"" and play their games. If you choose not to do this, there could be problems for you. And please remember, young women, you will always lose in this scenario. They have all the power and you will always lose. This company is located in Virginia and you can be fired at any time for no reason at all and be given a negative review and recommendation. This is not a positive place for women. I felt very discouraged and sad by what I saw - I thought the 1950's days of ""Mad Men"" were over, but not here they aren't.","1.0

To add insult to injury the new management has also decided not to pay out quarterly bonuses as agreed upon previously (and to be completely incommunicado as to why or what's going on).

It's sad to see that the majority of them have now left the company or have plans to leave.,"I have worked in multiple departments at this company and have seen dissatisfaction from many of the employees. The employees do not get compensated for their hard work and the bonuses for Q1 were cut in HALF for the Tech Support department. Not to mention, when employees are promoted, their compensation stays the same. This is another main reason why people keep leaving this company. It seems that the executives think the people in Tech Support are easily replaceable as if the years of experience with the product can be replaced in a matter of weeks or months. There practically will be no Tech Support department with the rate knowledgeable employees are leaving. Almost everyone I know in that department has plans of quitting, or are thinking about quitting. Every week more and more talented support engineers are leaving the company and the more the executives ignore this issue, the more it is apparent that they do not care about the quality of service customers will receive when calling into Technical Support. Sure, you can hire newbies as replacements but will they know how to solve P1 cases? Who will they turn to for help when the only people left in the department are newbies as well? The fact that the organizational structure in the Technical Support department was changed even though the majority, if not all, of the employees expressed their concerns and dissatisfaction, shows that the opinions of the employees were not taken into consideration by the executives. Also note that before the change happened, the upper level management team was given a list of the people who would leave if the department were to change. In regards to working in different departments, if you were to move to a different city with higher cost of living, you will NOT be compensated accordingly. Try living in a city where the rent is more than half of your monthly salary. Also, the phrase “Let me get back to you” seems to be the phrase of choice when upper level management is confronted about issues such as compensation, project availability, etc. Poor communication among the different levels of management is another huge con. All compensation changes, and financial decisions have to go through the CEO so the process takes an enormous amount of time. If you do some research you will notice that the majority of consultants at this company are GDC consultants. If GDC consultants were to leave the company, they would have to leave the country as well due to Visa reasons. Because of this, most of them are basically forced to stay with the company. It is an ongoing trend that if you have the ability to leave the company (US citizen), you will most likely do so and I have seen plenty of other consultants who end up leaving within 6 months due to the poor compensation, and project availability. If you look at Lithium (Forum for consultants) you will notice that a lot of consultants are on the bench and are not staffed on projects. Sure, consultants have ""uncapped"" quarterly bonuses, but it doesn't really matter when you can't get on a billable project. Also take into consideration that the employees in the Technical Support department were only given 50% of their Q1 bonuses...","1.0

We work hard but also have a lot of fun. - Finally got MSTR 10 out of the door,- Took Technical Support from a product based structure to one based on regions with every engineer having to know every aspect of the product. - Toxic work environment. Everyone feels overworked and under appreciated. Unmotivated and disgruntled employees leads to lackluster performance which is exactly what is happening. - The company is bleeding away talent. Experienced engineers that have been with the company 2+ years are leaving a huge void in terms of knowledge. Back fills and hiring of new engineers is not happening so teams are half of what they used to be and are severely understaffed. With the numbers and experience we have now we cannot properly support our customers and meet SLAs. Are customers are visibly frustrated and upset with the quality of service they are receiving. As more people leave the more the workload increases for the ones that are left behind. With the release of MSTR 10 the workload has increased since it has been one of the buggiest products we have launched in recent history. - Lack of communication from Business Unit Managers and management. The direction of the department and company are unclear and most of the news that makes it's way to the bottom is through the grapevine. Engineers do not trust their Business Unit Managers. - Only 5 merit increases for each Business Unit and 50% payout of bonuses. Many engineers considered this a huge slap in the face. Each Business Unit Manager was only allowed to pick 5 engineers to get merit increases. A few of them used it to compensate engineers that were waiting for their salary increase due to promotion (some individuals had to wait 6+ months after taking new positions for the salary increase) while others used it to try and save engineers that expressed discontent. For the ones that got the increase to cover a promotion the increase was pitiful.,"1.0

New ideas are not encouraged - in fact ideas that conflict with the vision of the CEO have been met with firings. Career advancement is only possible by agreeing unwaveringly and blindly following the directive of the executive team at all times without exception. A LOT of deep institutional knowledge of the software platform has left the development and sales teams over the past 9 months. That cannot be replaced. The company does not value its employees. They are simply numbers on a spreadsheet eating into cost centers. The company will nickel and dime you over compensation and bonuses every chance they get. They will cry poverty and slash bonuses for loyal hard-working employees that have made it through very difficult times while the stock soars and the execs receive kickers for hitting short term profit targets (by laying off employees). All of these are entirely self-inflicted. The company succeeds in spite of its executive management, not because of it.","1.0

There's some law in physics about how isolated closed systems tend towards maximum entropy. There is no more isolated closed system than MicroStrategy. Recommendations from analysts, employees, clients, executives who were hired externally (and then promptly fired or whipped into submission), etc., all go unheeded by the highest executives like an action sequence in a comic book. ""We think you should focus less on your 'security' product and more on analytics"" says the analyst. KABLAM, here's 2.5 hours of Usher during our keynote sessions at World. ""We think you should show more compassion towards employees after last year's two rounds of layoffs"" says someone in human resources. POW WHAM BAM, let's forget about employee morale, consider skipping this annual cycle of raises, then settle on just giving people delayed minimal raises with zero transparency about our motivations. ""We think we need to focus on these 5 things to fix our sales and marketing pipeline"" says the new executive marketing team. ZABOINGO, nope not today, how about we fire you and then slash marketing's budget. The chaos trickles down, too. One week you'll be working on Project A which is most definitely a ""top priority"" and then your manager's manager will have a meeting with a particular executive and that executive says ""Project A is worthless, why were you ever working on it, we need to focus on Project B."" So now you're working on Project B with no real idea why it's better or more important than Project A was. And this happens ad infinitum until you're working on Project Z and all excitement and jubilance you had when you started your job has drained out of you like a diamond ring down a toilet.

In addition to Microstrategy cooking the books a few years ago (according to the SEC), it seems they are also trying to manipulate their reviews. For an honest review of the company, read the negative reviews here in the last 6 months or so. Ever since the CEO decided to come back to manage the company (after spending too much time on his yachts, going to Hollywood parties, and being a bachelor playboy who hangs out with 18 year old bikini models) as a result of the Apex letter, the company has been in a downward spiral. Not only did they lay off a significant percentage of the workforce in an attempt to show profitability, but most of the company's best and brightest employees have left or are in the process of leaving, primarily due to poor management. In the corporate office, employees are terrified. The mood and morale there is lower than I have ever seen. No one knows if they will be let go the next day or if their manager will be forced out or leave for a better position elsewhere. In the field, it's much the same: all of the best account executives and sales engineers are leaving. I think that speaks to how poorly managed the company is, and that comes from the top down. As others have said, the CEO thinks he is the smartest person in the company, and none of the top executives are willing to contradict him (because those that do end up being shown the door). He surrounds himself with ""yes"" men as a result, so bad decisions run rampant. No wonder it is a sinking ship and all the good people are fleeing. When it comes to commissions, the commission structure changes all the time. It isn't unusual to work on an account and expect a large commission only to find that the company has found some reason not to pay you the commission you expect. Microstrategy has some great products, and Usher shows a lot of promise. But there are so many internal problems, it's hard to see how the company will continue with the kind of success they had before the CEO came back to ""manage"". Everyone I know is looking for jobs elsewhere, and the brain drain is evident.","1.0

This is evident in the Cloud business where the company prefers to get rid of long time customers if they are not willing to accept changes in the latest offering. Small partners are not being paid invoices if they don't reach a certain dollar threshold as it is easier to fight them of with an army of lawyers, than pay them.

The sense of depression walking the halls cannot be put into words. The CEO is not capable of running a public company by any reasonable standard. He has no business leadership education or experience and it smacks you in the face in every company call or meeting. Most founders would have sold and moved on to a new venture by now but his arrogance and total control ownership status makes this impossible for him to do apparently. It is hard to imagine anyone caring less about their employees. Or getting more personal satisfaction out of berating and belittling those he meets with. You can hear yourself humming ""those poor unfortunate souls"" from The Little Mermaid while Ursala sucks the voice out of Ariel. Because no one but the CEO has a voice on anything. Current and future customers should do their homework before making additional investments. There are other products on the rise and catching up fast. And many of them are hiring away what's left of MicroStrategy's talent. Unless something changes at the top, it's hard to see how the product stays viable long-term without talent to enhance it.

This type of problem solving is exactly why this company is not somewhere I would recommend working.

Many of these people I would gladly work with again. This has also been a huge resume builder for me.

You must carve your own path though.","TLDR: CEO does not understand internal needs, bleeding out the company through loss of individuals, any new senior management is silenced or forced out, CEO involved in to much minutia (example multiple revamp of system wide reporting), outside of tech no room for advancement. Unfortunately all the companies ills fall to one person: Michael Saylor. After the Apex Capital letter Saylor has come back in full force. This has been a nightmare for the rest of us. The man might now software but he does not understand people. He believes that we are all interchangeable cogs and that we do not need training in order to do another person's job. We have had several Senior Executives who have come in that have made me in operations excited to see change. They have either been fired for telling Saylor no, have quit because of the madness, or have been put in a corner where they can just spin their wheels. Since Saylor has come back our internal processes have had to change on a weekly basis. Our system wide reporting have been revamped by him personally several times in 2 months. A CEO should not be worrying about this level of minutia. Never thought I would say it but please send him back to his yacht and let us work. Yes there were the layoff and they sucked but we have continued to hemorage people since then. Normally you have to clot the wound even if it is self inflicted but Saylor and senior management are literally letting the company bleed out.

Folks rolled up their sleeves and worked together here in the past. Vacation and medical benefits are good.,"Just one that is the root of ALL others: The CEO, Michael Saylor. He views himself as above all others, and as the sole reason that the company has had any success. Don’t forget that fact when dealing with him. If you do, you will feel the wrath of a small man pretending to be a big shot business leader, who is desperately and pathetically hoping he’ll someday be in the conversation along with the great technology innovators of our time. MicroStrategy used to be a great place to work. Well, all that changed when Mr. Saylor’s performance as CEO was put into question by people he couldn’t bully: Institutional Investors. The punishment for their discovery of his own lavish, company-funded extravagancies, was a full-force, and in rapid succession, set of austerity measures for his employees. Also a large set of draconian processes to be adopted immediately and forcefully. And a hiring spree of unnecessary executives who may have had honest aspirations of leading the company, but in reality, are now Yes Men hanging around just long enough to cash in their options grant. Mr. Saylor is completely out of touch with his work force (not that he cares), and the reality of the situation he’s recently created at MicroStrategy. The company is being systemically destroyed by a dictatorial figurehead. He has single-handedly wiped out the existing culture and has driven away a very experienced and tenured human-talent base. TO BE CLEAR: ALL of the Top Engineering and Sales talent has already left or is currently leaving. All that is left is a single-minded CEO, and his Executive staff nodding their bowed heads in fealty and submission. This is the BI Titanic sinking here.

However, upper management does not seem to care too much about them.","1. Lack of unified direction from CXOs. 2. Management is trying to do too many things all at once. In the end, nothing is accomplished. 3. Salary raises/promotions are very rare. I have worked for the company for 3 years and I never once got my full bonus. 4. The company is struggling financially. There were 2 rounds of layoffs, possibly more to come if Usher doesn't pull through. 5. Morale among the people is very low. This has not been addressed in any way by management and as such resulted in key talent leaving the company to pursue better options. Most essential/key people in key roles have already left. 6. If you work here, pray that you don't end up working on the 14th floor alongside the CEO. For the same pay your stress will be 100x, you'll pull in long hours and be expected to always be on his schedule. You will hear a lot of cursing and always wonder if you're about to get fired. 7. Usher is THE only app that actually makes me hate my phone from time to time. It will never catch on but the CEO keeps onto his vision and has invested more than 30% of company resources into developing this ""Security Platform"" that is buggy and has essentially only one customer so far: Microstrategy. I do hope it will eventually sell as there are many smart people working on it. 8. I already mentioned the layoffs..there is a pattern of over-hiring during good years to pursue Saylor's many grand visions about products. This leads to the company becoming financially unstable and then mass layoffs follow. 9. It's a good first job if you're fresh out of college or an intern.

His only idea that has turned out to be successful is the one he had when he founded the company. More than 20 years ago…..But all that was OK because even if he wasted precious resources on these silly ideas, for the most part he left the core Analytics team alone. But it all changed one year ago when he decided he would not be an absentee CEO anymore and he was going to demonstrate again that he is a thought leader and visionary….He has pushed Usher, a security product that nobody cares about, and distracted all groups in the company. He has pretty much fired or pushed out all the Senior Management team. The only ones that survive are YES men that have no backbone or good idea. He forced a full reorganization of the Marketing and Technology groups forcing a big exodus of talent. In addition, the new CTO could not care less about the people and it almost seems like he is doing everything in his power to fail.

You will be forced to push products that the clients don't want while filling out spreadsheets that show that you've pitched the client, 5.) You will have to pay for sales related expenses that the company should typically provide (Internet, Mobile Phone, Wireless Access) 6.) You won't be provided a single lead because all of those leads are being given to the inside sales team since Saylor thinks that a webex, and slick demo and a brand new inside sales rep can sell enterprise software deals to clients remotely, 7.)

To put things into proper context, we have more than 10 years of track record in delivering high quality products without using any agile practices. In my time, my proudest moment was how we put in hours late into the night and on weekends to deliver our mobile platform. We beat all our competitors in being the first mobile BI platform. We did not need any agile practices or tracking tools to hold ourselves accountable. We did it because it was a cause we believed in and were highly motivated to push ahead.

Morale is incredibly low and is only getting worse. The people who are left are demotivated and overworked as they are picking up the slack from everyone who has resigned and left the company since the layoffs started back in September. There is no decision making power outside of the CEO's office and very few people, if any, have the ability to influence the direction, structure, or compensation for own their teams anymore. It is apparent that the CEO only appreciates complete agreement based on his latest ""circle of trust"". He doesn't listen to feedback from anyone who doesn't agree with him, not even from the high level executives that he hired to run various parts of the business that are only looking to implement best practices in their organizations. MSTR has never had a strong or well-rounded Education program for internal employees, but we were well known for our 6 week bootcamp training that resulted in the MCD (MicroStrategy Certified Developer) certification. All new technical employees received this training upon joining the company. This is now going away and there are rumors that it will be replaced by a one week bootcamp that will simply be a crash course in our products. It is bad enough that there is no formalized continuing education programs for technical or professional skills, but to eliminate the one big investment that the company was making in a large number of our employees to get them basic MSTR skills is incredibly disappointing. Our customers and partners are acutely aware of the dysfunction happening at MSTR and it is beginning to affect our sales cycles. Companies are starting to not want to be associated with us, candidates aren't interested in joining the company, and a large majority of the current employee base is actively looking to leave the organization. If I had reviewed this company even 6 months ago, my feedback would have been completely different. Unfortunately this seems to be consistent with the recent reviews and also the trend reporting. I hope that MSTR can turn things around however, it will take some drastic positive changes from the top and I've lost confidence that this will happen any time soon.","1.0

There have been several restructures lately with minimal communication, creating massive change management issues. Many of the employee-trusted,long term executives and management have left the company. The perception is the the CEO has pushed them out to bring in folks that will not question his ideas or corporate plans. This has caused a massive shift in work/life balance where executives are providing minimal value or direction to the company and the employees trying to hold the company together are working extremely long hours, under large amounts of stress. When management is questioned, they rarely provide answers to future direction, reasons for changes, or why something is being done today. When they do answer, they appear as baffled by some of the decisions being made as the rest of the employees and often imply that it was what was demanded of the CEO. Thus continuing the cycle of mis-trust that has encapsulated MicroStrategy in 2014. My hope is that this is a temporary problem that can begin to resolve itself in the next 6-months to 1-year.","1.0

Current projected GA is not even close to a finished product. Looks like baselines are being adjusted just to qualify.,CTO - 0 vision. Not sure how he even got the post. Absolutely no idea about BI and Analytics. Pretty much brown nosed his way to the top and induced a toxic culture of agree or leave. The company has been on a downward spiral ever since he took over. Look at the historical numbers. Recently hired a couple of SVP's to cover his deficiencies. Created silos just to save his position.,"1.0

Lack of strategy, lack of direction from management and the frequency of executive-level 'fire-drills' (complicated projects due the same day in order to appease our CEO). My job description has nothing to do with my job - I have found that I am employed because I know how to use a computer. The utter dissatisfaction I feel each day with myself and my job.","1.0

Interesting ideas for new products (though poorly executed, I'll get to that in a minute)","I wanted to give more stars for the extremely talented middle managers and co workers who bring incredible experience and ideas to the table. In the right environment they would be successful, but the upper management at the highest level really has no idea how to nurture innovation with processes that make sense in today's technology industry. How can the company compete when the CEO has bi-weekly or weekly reviews that create panic and sap every resource to satisfy his needs, which are not the market's needs? The best people cannot succeed in this environment. The current climate is kind of like the pre-Baratheon Realm in GoT. The CEO is the Mad King - if someone truly challenges him and the way he runs the company, he disposes of them. The people that remain around him are yes men who are afraid to do things the right way for the very real threat of getting ousted. Unless one of the new product lines succeeds despite the CEO hampering true innovative and productive work and draining morale, his reign will crumble like the Targaryen's did, and the Baratheons and Starks of the market (Tableau, Qlik, etc.) will take over. Also this analogy makes MSTR seem better than it is - it never really was king of the BI market. And never will be as long as Saylor is there.","1.0

Leadership, especially executive leadership, continually make decisions that can disrupt the flow of ideas, progress, and the ability of the business to grow in a healthy manner. I find that people who come here start off very positive but eventually come to a similar of understanding that there is a growing disconnect between upper management and the people who really make that platform work!
