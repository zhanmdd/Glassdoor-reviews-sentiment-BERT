I could not be more impressed with how WWT leadership -- from exec team to individual managers -- has responded in handling adversity and disruption on multiple fronts. The consistency of messaging has made it crystal clear on where WWT remains focused and what we need to do moving forward to succeed — not only from a business perspective, but also a social responsibility standpoint. Culture and values are something many companies talk about, but rarely execute on -- in my experience. I quickly realized this was not the case at WWT. And if there was any doubt, it was completely wiped out given how WWT has reacted throughout 2020.",No cons to provide at this time.,"5.0

I'll explain the ""culture"" part a little more for those who are dubious of how big an impact culture can have on your day-to-day job experience. I came to WWT from a much larger, publicly traded corporation (20k+ employees) where I learned to excel at the corporate ladder game — 5 jobs in 5 years, chasing salary bumps as quickly as I could within a defined system of promotions and lateral moves. You either learned to climb or were passed over. While I made some great friends in those 5 years, friends to this day, I eventually burned out. Luckily, a former colleague had moved to WWT. He knew what I was going through and told me WWT was different. (“Sure it is,” I thought while secretly believing every company operated in the same manner). Regardless, I took a chance and applied for a position. I needed a change. In my first year at WWT, I kept trying to put my finger on what felt different. Yes, it was a smaller company. Yes, it was privately owned. But that didn't really explain why the atmosphere at work every day felt tangibly different. After 5 years with WWT, I can confidently identify the difference between the two companies. Despite both companies having a ""core set of values,"" only one of them consistently lived and operated by those values from the top down. The other company merely paid lip service to them. No amount of ""writing the company's value on the cafeteria walls"" could overcome the fact that the primary feeling permeating my former office on a daily basis alternated between dread and ennui (likely spread by staggering level of mid-level micromanagement). Any company can lay claim to a ""great culture,"" but until it's put into practice on a daily basis at every level of management, it's just an idea. It took me around a year to become un-jaded from my prior experience. Thankfully, the great culture part of WWT has remained intact since I started. Now we just have to keep it going as we grow, which will definitely be a challenge as we bring on more people. But it’s a task I know the executive leadership team is up for.","Salaries are competitive but not the highest (this is a tech company, after all). You shouldn't expect huge bonuses (outside Sales) nor stock options since it's private. There is some profit sharing though. But these are trade-offs for better work/life balance I'm happy to make.","5.0

Their healthcare benefits are outstanding for a company of this size. Some of WWT's managers and senior leaders are wonderful. The CEO is charismatic, kind, and supportive. The COO/CFO is top notch.","Operating outside of corporate values doesn't cause WWT senior leadership to terminate bad managers, as long as those managers continue to produce good results. This gap in values is portrayed as ""Do as I say, not as a do"" and that degree of insincerity fosters a toxic culture, manifesting mediocre team members who cater to poor leaders. Management and other leaders push a Christian belief construct, which results in marginalization of employees. Compensation for consultants in certain areas is under market value. Upward mobility is click-ish and not often merit based. Strategic staffing (staff augmentation) operates better than many recruiters; however, that is an exceptionally low bar and performance could be improved greatly. There are recruiters who are exceptional, though they are few.","4.0

Work life balance is well respected and there are many ways to strengthen relationships with co-workers including game nights, burrito club, etc. If you are a developer mid - junior you will benefit greatly from the overall practice of TDD and paired programming employed here.","I would highly recommend that anyone considering joining the application services segment of WWT that is mid or above consider the following. - The PTO policy is in a single bucket with sick leave. - The PTO policy is accrual based with no increase for 5 years. - Application Services leans on the self starter mentality to a fault at times. You will need to be willing to find your own way through process. - Pairing is often considered a replacement for well thought out code reviews. Code reviews often allow for an individual to look at the code from an academic standpoint. They provide different functions. - Developer teammates often will want work straight on master and use the CI/CD pipeline as a crutch. - You may be hired as a developer of a particular language or stack, but you will be staffed based on need. - The St Louis office feels like the number 1 office. - Application Services (formally Asynchrony Labs) is slowly becoming overtaken by the overall WWT merger in terms of corporate culture and identity.","3.0

But, most of the people at WWT live, breath, and practice the core values across all levels, areas, and groups within the company. In my experience, this creates an experience that is truly unique for employees, customers, and partners. The company really does put its people first. The work/life balance or integration is excellent. Compensation is typically highly competitive. The benefits (medical, 401k, etc...) are amazing.",The fast rate of growth and a tendency for some groupthink out of headquarters in St. Louis can and have put real strains on the company culture that has otherwise been so carefully cultivated at WWT.,"5.0

When I was interviewing at WWT, I was asked why I made at my previous job, and they offered me that exact amount even though the position was a vertical move. When I told them this, they promised that I would be getting regular merit increases. I never saw a merit increase higher than 2% per year the entire time I was at WWT. They also do little to no career planning for employees. Many people are stuck in the same roles for years with nowhere to move up to without leaving their team. It is hard to feel appreciated as an employee when you are not getting any sort of raise or promotion for years on end, and are not given any indication of when you might see one. I saw some people get “promoted” and then told they wouldn’t be given a raise because the “title change should be enough”. The culture is frequently used as an excuse to not pay employees the market value of their jobs.","2.0

Most people are generally great to work with and will go out of their way to help you. Working remotely is great benefit as well.","WWT is notorious for paying below the industry average and not giving out raises unless you have a senior fighting tooth and nail for you. Myself and others have been lied to about pay and compensation for achieving career milestones. There's no clear path as to how to advance. It's just a matter of grinding as hard as you can and hoping senior leadership listens to your peers trying to fight for a promotion/raise on your behalf. Bureaucracy and useless processes from the PMO is killing the efficiency of engineers, quality of their work, and overall morale and motivation. Scope creep and un-signed agreements made by those that are not technical and not doing the day-to-day heavy lifting burden everyone on the project. There's going to be plenty of time where you'll be overworked in PS. Working early/late because of customers half way across the world, traveling and working long hours for multiple weekends in a row, given strict and unreasonable deadlines for certain tasks add on to this.

They will make you laugh and are easy to get along with but everyone there also wants everyone to get better and will challenge eachother and help them grow and improve. If you are on 2nd shift you also have a group that will help you from others than maybe dont have the same attitude.,Sometimes the first shift dynamic with 2nd is rather toxic. Toxic individuals are not let go and in some cases are even promoted. The company does not want to have an US vs Them mentality when it comes to 1st and 2nd shift but it usually seems that 2nd shift is the only one that strictly enforces this policy or some people are just allowed to do whatever and no punishment given. This is not the same everywhere obviously and while im typing this I def. have an area in mind but regardless 2nd shift is worth it just for the amount of support and unity there is on 2nd shift alone.,"4.0

You can get new hardware pretty easily. - Free soda - Set your own hours (within reason) - Ability to work from home (as needed) - Friendly co-workers - Encourages learning through feedback,"ulting work means you sometimes have bad clients. The company used to be pretty good about ""shielding"" its workers from sub-par experiences such as unrealistic client expectations that would require overtime to meet. Not so much anymore. Feels like we are getting more and more clients who do not want to buy into Agile, these clients just want to throw more people at the problem. Many clients come to us with half built or poorly performing apps, which leads to many seemingly unnecessary constraints. Can be good a good challenge, however once you've seen different clients make the same mistakes you've seen before it becomes frustrating. Frustrating when people ""on our side"" (as opposed to the client side) simply write the problem on a sticky and stick it on a board labeled risks. It used to be you did what needed to be done even if it was outside of your primary role, specifically regarding story planning/writing and client relations. Within the past year it seems many new roles have been added to fill this need, which has greatly increased team size. Yet these new roles are not dedicated so they're very busy, almost too busy to do what they're supposed to do. We as a department, used to be flat, but every few months it seems like another management role is created. There used to be three types of people (Dev, QA, Design) now there are so many roles and titles it's impossible to keep anyone's job straight.

Tue Sep 10 2019 08:47:24 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Sales,,Current Employee ,Good not Great,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 10 years,"- Healthcare benefits are incredibly cheap. Onsite Health Clinics at St. Louis Location. Mental health applications as well as on-site consultants. - Some positions allow for flex-schedules and work from home opportunities - Top level executives truly do believe and mean what they say - I believe they are actually genuine in their goals, and their vision of a great place to work with a great culture - but unfortunately much like the ""telephone game"" the messaging is lost as its passed down through middle management. The company is getting too big and the impact the executives once had on culture is dwindling due to rapid growth. Town halls and questionnaires are great for connecting with the executives, but the impact has little lasting effects when the middle management, who leads the day to day operations and don't exhibit the same culture (they talk about the culture a lot, but living it is different) People do fall in love with the executive leadership. Jim and Dave have great humble personalities. Even middle management loves the messaging....its just harder to get middle management to act on the message. - Hackathon/Innovation projects are projects where employees are encouraged to develop a new product/process/initiative. These are pretty neat and employees are encouraged to join and even allocated business hours to work on these. - Day of Caring - WWT gives a day for employees each year to give back to the community - whether in a group or on your own - to volunteer for the cause of your own personal choosing. This does not impact your PTO and you can take this day at any point throughout the year. - Wellness Screening Bonus PTO - every year WWT offers a ""wellness screening"" in which you can volunteer to have your blood tested for high cholesterol, glucose, etc etc and not only do they do this for the good of your own health, but you get an additional PTO day for anyone who has completed this screening as part of WWT's health awareness initiatives. - The core values are truly fantastic. Whether or not they are executed on by every employee could be disputed, however the foundation and backbone of ""THE PATH"" (Trust, Humility, Embrace Change, Passion, (Positive) Attitude, Team Player, Honestyand Integrity) is a great moral compass to lean on.","- WWT says a lot of good things. We say we are a great place to work. We talk about good leaders. We say ""no bad managers."" We say ""open door policy""....we are really great at talking. Not so good at doing and acting on these words. We drink a lot of Kool Aid and have become to lose the meaning of our words, unfortunately. After 13 years with this company it really has changed. The messaging is still positive and consistent from corporate and they have truly great goals and visions, but unfortunately its a lot of talk....the bad managers run rampant, the perks are becoming fewer and far between with budget constraints. GHQ seems to offer much more benefits (tickets to race events at a local St. Louis racetrack, concert tickets at times) but the satellite offices are left in the dark and many are left wondering (whats so great about WWT compared to any other company?) - Most of the current focus has been on the warehouse side of things, but WWT has been continuously slipping in all areas of the business. In sales, engineering, etc. Part of this is due to growing pains, but many things are simply due to lack of training in some instances and wrong seat on the bus in others. If you check Fortune's Great Places to Work list (which WWT greatly prides itself on) you will notice that they have consistently fallen on that list year over year. - There are a couple regional sales managers that are very rude and arrogant to internal teams (sales ops, labs, SRC, etc) in order to get what they want. Top level management is aware, but conditions have not changed. This bad attitude then seeps into the account level sales teams and poor attitudes become the norm. - Other regional sales managers are very highly qualified sales reps, but they lack the skills to manage a team. They were promoted due to their success with their customers - but this does not translate into being an effective manager/leader. - WWT tends to grease the squeakiest wheels. The employees (especially sales reps) that whine and complain the most, cut the lines, break process, and steamroll over others tend to get what they want the fastest, while humble, rule following, culture abiding reps get pushed aside in lieu of pacifying the non-culture fit. -Training is continuously lacking. We blame ""fast growth"" on lack of in-depth training new hires, but when ""Growth Company"" is a literal corporate goal - are we actually expecting business to slow down enough to properly train someone? The answer is we won't and we don't. We're obsessed with growing so rapidly that the bubble will eventually burst, we will lose many good tenured employees (check last month's termination report - a dozen 6-10+ year employees jumped ship) and eventually WWT will become a hollow shell because the best folks will no longer tolerate the atmosphere. - WWT has been saying ""we are experiencing growing pains"" for the last 5+ years. Its an excuse for ""hey thats the norm around here."" They've put different initiatives in place (Business Process Improvement, BPI) and others, but many of them have taken years to roll out and the end results for those processes that have rolled out see minimal performance improvement gains. WWT is trying but employees aren't feeling the weight lifted off their shoulders - Still a constant struggle for tenured employees to get appropriate raises from the inside. If you want a solid increase, the common joke is that you have to leave the company and come back - which is something many employees have done. WWT is much more focused on hiring people from Cisco, Dell, NetApp, DiData/NTT, Insight, etc than growing ISRs and internal folks who actually know WWT's inner workings - Its extremely hard for an ISR or Ops person to make the transition into outside sales. A few have done it through the Federal/GSP space, but its difficult unless you're the son/daughter of an executive (nepotism is popular at world wide....however many of the relatives are very hard working people and nepotism isn't innately a bad thing, but in certain instances special roles/exceptions have been created for family that otherwise wouldn't have been created at all). - WWT is popular for what I'd call the ""delayed compensation promotion"" in which you are promoted to a new role and you are given the new title, tasks/responsibilities, etc - but told you will not have your pay adjusted until the first of the year. For instance was once promoted to a team lead in March and was told that an appropriate increase for my responsibilities would come in January the following year due to budgets and it would be ""too hard"" for finance to adjust pay mid-year. This has been a common theme for many employees - HR/Finance should make it easier for managers to give mid-year raises if they are merited. The replies on Open Door and Glass Door to this one continuously say that ""we pay accordingly and promotions should come with a raise"" but that doesn't happen in practice. Even in lateral role changes where a raise might not be ""expected"" HR needs to realize that managers are telling employees that they will get a large bump, but it won't come until the next year because they can't get funding for it - but that role change comes with more responsibilities (hence managers saying an increase will come). So regardless of if its a lateral move or a promotion - employees are being told by managers that they aren't allowed to increase pay or have been told its too difficult to increase pay until the budgets are set the next year. This isn't a one manager thing either. Three different managers have said the same thing - so hopefully this bullet isn't glossed over with a ""well a promotion should come with a raise"" or ""if it was a lateral move that doesn't come with a raise"" - when managers are saying that the raise simply can't be approved until the next year.","2.0

Not, its not perfect. But no place is. What makes it unique in my view is the degree to which the company truly cares about making the work environment positive. Not many company's have as part of their mission being a ""great place to work."" It is one of the three pillars, along with profitability and growth. Without all three, as you will hear from leadership, you can't create a challenging, great place to work that will sustain the test of time. In particular, in recent months the company has been strained. In particular, the hardworking members of our warehouse teams who have been trying to move a 1.5 million sq ft facility while also keeping orders moving per customer demand. This is an amazing feat no matter how you look at it. Have there been misses? Yes, Have there been long hours and hard work. Double yes. And Executive leadership knows it and appreciates it. That doesn't make it easier, and it doesn't make the sacrifices by those teams feel less like sacrifice. There is no perfect way to thank or appreciate people for that kind of hard work, but I do think leadership is trying. Benefits are good. They are on par with those of other major companies, but much better than most mid-sized or small companies. And the health insurance is really fantastic by any standards. I know that isn't something you can always see if you aren't sick or your kids / spouse aren't sick, but trust me, when they are you will appreciate the difference.","The company has been on a hockey stick growth pattern for a while now. That has caught up to it. More investment is needed in leadership at the mid-level. Promotion from within is great, but in some cases the people in those jobs were not ready to take on the job as it grew beneath their feet. Focus on systems and processes.","5.0

Sat Sep 21 2019 14:01:15 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Edwardsville, IL",Former Employee ,Greatest place to work? For who? (Shipping),I worked at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 5 years,"Benefits, company parties, and if you have an obsession with Papa John's Pizza there is plenty of it to go around.","Terrible Management, Terrible Employees (ZERO core values), Hypocritical, and do not actually listen to employees whatsoever when voicing concerns. Let me start by saying I worked for this company for almost 5 years and had/have seen so many things change for the worse. Here are a few. I worked my heart out and in return I left because I refused to pour so much into a company that refused to give me a promotion because my ""interview skills"" were not up to their standard. Meanwhile still expecting me to continue to do the job of someone who got paid more. Leadership is a circus and empty shell of what it was when I first started. They forced out a manager because she was ""too mean"" and employees didn't like actually being told to work and not just sit around on their phones, DRINK on the clock and post photos of drugs on their Snapchat. Multiple employees hit equipment and product and are not drug tested or if they are, they use fake urine or other methods to pass. When pay was raised we were threatened with termination if we talked about it even though this is your right and freedom of speech. When it all came to light it turned out that it was not actually a raise. Those who had been working there and made close to what the overall raise was ($14 an hour) were given pennies while the most lazy and useless workers saw gains of up to $2. Every six months or so they gave this big smoke show on how well we were doing and how much the company is growing and is a great place to work... Yet here I am at another company because I could not stand to see my hard work and dedication wasted on such ignorant people. Everyone plays favorites; No matter the department. Shipping is by far no acceptation, if anything it is the worst place to be. Leads and Supervisors sleeping around with employees and other staff, and when proof of these events happening were brought out to light, HR made the ones who voiced the issue out to be in the wrong. Now they are left with people who actually care about work culture and meeting goals who are now too afraid to even voice their opinions and concerns. There is almost nothing good to say about WWT's shipping department or their HR department. Mirrors and smoke with no actual solutions and working good employees into early graves. But hey, $14 an hour to do what ever you want and not actually meet company goals.","2.0

Sat Sep 21 2019 15:25:41 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Edwardsville, IL",Current Employee ,Can be a great place to work.,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 5 years,"Benefits, work sponsored parties... That's about it. Depending on the luck of the draw(department, supervisor, etc) you get placed in.. you MAY be in a great place to work.","First and foremost, the most significant con would be that I strongly disbelieve that WWT has the right people, in the right places. It's almost as if we've completely forgotten the building blocks, or core structure, of the company... The core values. I'm not sure what the criteria for becoming management, or leadership, is these days.. but it's not confidence inspiring for the employees. In the last 3 years, regarding shipping at least(and most likely many other departments), I've not seen one change in leadership that has actually improved the business, whether that's culturally or strictly business. There was once a manager, while she could be strict, was passionate about her job, she made people work though.. and people didn't like that. What we are left with now, are managers too afraid to do their job. Even going as far, as to hide and/or cover up things that should absolutely end in termination for the employees involved(ie. leadership sleeping with associates, selling/using drugs and/or alcohol on the premises WHILE working, getting drug tested and using fake urine etc.). I focus so strongly on leadership, because I truly believe that's were a great place to work starts at. To summarize leadership(in shipping), I'd say that.. Leadership is not in a great place. There are almost no core values shared among leadership, no structure, and in turn.. you have an extremely low morale among the associates. Furthermore, the issues go beyond management. The associates... It's almost as if the quality of associate has went downhill in the last few years. I've seen maybe a handful of people come in, motivated, and ready to take on the job they signed up for. Most, come in.. with little to no drive. The work ends up getting pushed on to senior employees, which seems fine.. but, ultimately, it stops there. The new hires never get any better. This leads to my next point. We have a severe lack in training, and lack of consistent process for new hires. Almost every one who is new gets taught by someone, who hardly knows the process themselves. On top of that, so many of these people come in.. and refuse to listen to a *senior* associate, because they're ""not their boss"". In turn, management does nothing, so the new associate does everything in their own way.. leading to a disruption that leads to a lower quality of work. To counteract that, I highly recommend implementing a ""training team"", however that may look, in each department. A team of subject matter experts, training every new employ in that department. Lastly, concerning associates, the ones left have either been beaten down so low that they simply lack passion, or, they're new and have come in with no passion to begin with. To summarize WWT as a whole: I think it would, and COULD be a great place to work, IF they could step back for 2 seconds to view it as it is, and not as it was. What it is now, is something that has become nearly fully engulfed in believing that it is a great place to work.. instead of actually finding out, from the people doing it, whether it IS a great place to work. Compensate the level of work you desire, not the ""competitive pay"", would also help motivate people.","2.0

They setup a barely functional floor to do our jobs at the NAIC location. The receiving setup is a total disaster and I was told that because the company put millions of dollars into messing it up that their only solution is to just keep us on over time. Our productivity is suffering, we’re going against all of the 8 wastes that WWT preaches against on a daily basis, and every day I go into work they add something else on to make our process harder and more time consuming. To move up in the company you have to know the politics and suck up to your bosses. It’s ridiculous. I’ve seen people that have been here for years not be able to move up because they’re too good in the position that they’re in. These people also make the same rate of pay that I do and I’ve only been here going on 2 years. A corporation is a corporation. The CORE values mean nothing to this growing business anymore. It’s all just an illusion that they base their brainwashing on. It’s sad. WWT recently came out with their “Open Door” survey form. Allot like Glassdoor, but it’s only for people in the company to see. The HR rep that makes the comments on here and in Open Door is extremely good at blowing smoke. I’m pretty disappointed in whoever that person is. We wanted our voices heard, and you were sent to just shut us down yet give us a glimpse of false hope, basically . When I realized that this new program meant no changes for us no matter how many times we came up with ways this place could easily improve, I was done. WWT is growing too rapidly to become anything more than a “What Was” because they don’t know how to handle their internal problems. The benefits are good, but you can get the same benefits working at Walmart, so it’s not worth it in the end. My home life/work life balance is extremely crucial to me and this company claimed that they cared about it before they made a huge unnecessary move and stole my whole summer with my family. They know the good hard working people will stay because they have no choice. This is our livelihoods. We can’t put food on the table without the small amount of pay that they give us.","1.0

My fear for the near future is a loss of agile methodologies in favor of traditional command and control micromanagement style leadership, and a loss of technical expertise as the best developers are promoted to management, or leave the company for agile companies solving more interesting problems.","3.0

Fri Apr 26 2019 08:05:28 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Part of A HPT,,Current Employee ,So Much Potential - So Little Accountability,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 3 years,"There are a lot of great things that WWT has to offer and when you look around, there truly is opportunity to be successful. The organization has great people in certain areas and if you're fortunate enough to be connected to them, you will put yourself in a position to earn a trip on stage at GSM. Jim, Mike, Tony, Bob, Joe, and Matt embody what we should be as an organization and it is exciting to know we have the best of the best leading the team from St. Louis. We do have great people that have the passion and drive to make WWT what it is today. You will never see another organization that has everything that WWT has to offer and if you can figure out a way to learn the story, put that story together, and work smart, you can earn a great living while learning about technology. The benefits are fantastic and should not be overlooked or taken for granted. The healthcare benefits are a blessing when you compare them to what others in our industry pay and we are fortunate to have a company who has kept our premiums so low for this many years. Depending on your role within WWT, you have so many resources at your fingertips and the investments Jim has made will make you question how anyone can compete with WWT. We are the best in the industry and if you haven't bought into what we do, go talk with a HPT and figure out what they are doing.","There are no perfect places to work and rather than this be a list of cons, I feel as if this is more of a list of opportunities for WWT to get better. When you are not based at One World Wide Way, there doesn't seem to be any of the culture that everyone talks about and the feeling is that we use the word, culture, to compensate for things that we lack or to counterbalance others actions. The words and actions from individuals do not match which is a concern - do as I say, not as I do. I see the Executive Team living ""The Path"", but I am not sure that people outside of the Nepotism Ring would say that management, not leadership, live the same Core Values that Jim and team live. It is nice that everyone's brothers, sisters, college roommates, sons, daughters, cousins, nephews, nieces, wives, husbands, and in-laws work together, but is anyone evaluating whether these family members are the right people for the job roles they are in? It does become quite comical when you realize how widespread nepotism runs and when we were a 100-person, that type of hiring is fine, but not for a $11B company when we have sales goals that rely on these individuals to get their jobs done at a level that is above average. There truly is a lack of accountability that lives at WWT and mediocrity seems to be accepted in certain areas. idering the competitive spirit that the leadership team has, it is surprising that mediocrity continues without any changes being made across all areas within WWT. The organization talks about cutting expenses which is admirable and fair, but has anyone looked around at the teams who have not made their sales quota, who have missed their sales targets year after year, or who cannot sell anything except Cisco product? Not many account team changes from what we see and the overhead appears to be excessive. Align and Execute was the 2019 message we received and that is exactly what we need to do, but you cannot do these things unless changes are made at some of the Sr. Leadership positions (within the nepotism ring). Is anyone from outside the current payroll considered for prominent roles who can help us Align and Execute? A portion of the leadership team is comprised of 20-yr employees that do not seem to have a lot of fresh ideas outside of WWT or industry experience at running organizations that are critical to our long-term success.","3.0

WWT always brags about the benefits, but benefits only go so far for certain people. This is a sales driven company.

Tue Mar 26 2019 17:59:16 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Lab Technician,"Edwardsville, IL",Current Employee ,Growing company with an emphasis on the right people,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 5 years,"I have been apart of WWT for over 5 years now and it was one of the best career moves I've made. Don't get me wrong it is still a place to work so it has its ups and downs, but my coworkers continue to make it enjoyable. The team atmosphere here specifically at LKV (NAIC 1) is great to see considering the large increases in employees and volumes. There has not been a time that I've asked for help that someone wasn't willing to stop what they were doing to assist, and that includes leadership. One thing I have noticed even though we have more than tripled in size is that our leadership knows everyone's name. There has also been a noticeable difference in leaderships efforts as of late to maintain a healthy work-life balance and GPTW atmosphere which includes working on changes with the schedules, increased staffing, and small HPT's to keep the morale high through the exponential growth in the business.","It is seeming to get a little bit better as of late but it is visible on the floor that not everyone is a fit for WWT. We can see leadership coaching these employees but it seems like nothing is done and it causes issues with morale, leadership credibility, and their effectiveness. Us employees on the floor can tell that it is taxing on leadership and at times seems to be wasted efforts as nothing is being done. There is currently more focus on coaching the wrong people than developing the right people and that is extremely concerning to not only my development but my teams also. My other con is the employee to leadership ratio. When I was first hired we had a ratio of 1 lead and supervisor to every 10-15 people; which I feel like wasn't enough with how many meetings everyone is in. Now some supervisors have between 25-40 employees with only 1 or 2 leads. It seems like it is impossible to find leadership on the floor to ask questions which is extremely frustrating. Don't get me wrong I understand the need for meetings but we should still have enough leadership or captains on the floor so we can get questions addressed in a timely manner especially with how fast we have grown and how many new folks we have in our department. Lastly, it was addressed from executive leadership about competitive compensation. Although there were good strides to this at the end of the year I still feel that it needs to be re-evaluated as looking at other companies in the area we are still underpaid. There was a saying I've heard before ""Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don’t want to"" and I feel like that is not the case currently.","5.0

It is extremely affordable even with the whole family. I have seen a lot of reviews of people saying that they see nepotism and favoritism, but I have not seen that at all in the year and a half I have been here. My team inside global order opps is great. We all work well together, talk to each other, and help each other whenever we can. I also saw a review that said there are no women in upper management and the ones that are, are only there to make the company look better. I do not see that at all, especially in an office that is predominantly female. Jeree Hanavec, who now runs global order opps, seems to be VERY suited for her position. I have nothing but confidence in her leadership and I am extremely excited to see the changes she is making, but change takes time. We can not expect for these things to happen over night. Most of the complaints I have seen have come from the warehouse which I can not attest to, but in the office at GHQ the environment is great. I can work where I want and as long as I am getting my work done and doing my job no one is standing over my shoulder micromanaging me. Not to mention the telecommute schedule which is amazing. It is so nice to be able to work from home 2-3 days a week and be able to spend some extra time with the family on my lunch hours. My manger, Dawn Partel, is amazing. She works constantly to make sure we are confident in our abilities and that we have the tools we need to be successful. I plan on being at WWT for many years to come.",The only con that I can think of is the lack of GHQ-warehouse communication. As a buyer I have to ask for warehouse requests regularly and sometimes it seem like they either don't care or don't have time to respond.

Sat Feb 09 2019 07:03:46 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,"Great company, great benefits, but needs focus on the right people",I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 10 years,"I work at the Edwardsville LKV facility, in one of the major programs that has seen consistent growth and success year after year. In my tenure, I lived through and have seen improvements and greatly appreciate the efforts of all that helped make things better, starting with the executive team’s focus on culture first and the empowerment to allow employees on all levels to challenge and voice their opinions but also make a difference by submitting improvement ideas. I have had great support from management, HR and people I work with everyday. Management/leadership is available and engaged on the floor in most departments and employees have a sense of pride working at the facility. The company has great benefits and the benefits have gotten better as WWT stays competitive year after year against much bigger companies. I work with the majority of what I describe as awesome people, with much improved cross functional collaboration between departments and a mentality of teamwork and doing whatever it takes, volumes are crazy at times but the people are what makes a difference and you can see that in the success and longevity of the program. The facility runs round tables and skip levels, also focuses on presenting cultural topics in daily huddles, employee reviews, catering on holidays, recognizing weekly difference makers, engaging in fun contests and even catering drinks & ice cream in hot months, Christmas parties, potlucks, team outings, working on dealing and managing with sporadic volumes from a long term, satisfied customer. You see evidence of people that work hard get recognized and continue to grow and embrace opportunities, a lot of people come in when new and can’t believe how much better it is than previous companies they worked for. The recent town hall meeting delivered with improved subcontractor conversions, reviews and compensation.","Not much at this location, at times work life balance is difficult and work in progress but secure employment outweighs this if you have realistic expectations and willing to make the sacrifice. Growth has some pain points and having the time to do it all makes it difficult. There’s good transparency but communication can be always more clear and more effective, everyone normally doesn’t communicate at the same level. Overall I see the general cons at WWT that have come out recently as a mix of complacency, entitlement and lack of accountability on multiple levels; things that absolutely do not represent anything from the executive team, especially as they drive coaching peer to peer and management to employees or employees to management. Their drive and humility to build the foundation of this company needs to be enforced, not brought down by people that don’t care or complain. Some do not have a good understanding of the mission and vision and do not practice it, pointing the finger and complaining but never doing anything. It is easy to complain but the hard work and reward is in doing something about it. It is disappointing to see the comments that are out there on glass door, between a mix of empty promises and false expectations. Not everyone is suited for a new position every 6 months and some hop on every opportunity to get pay increase or promotion and leave their managers if they do not get what they want or think they deserve it, some managers are hired and they don’t grow in their roles for different reasons and they affect their teams. For those who care, everyone needs to voice their opinion on how great the company is.","5.0

It has been amazing to see the growth of the company since I have started. I have to say that working at WWT has changed my life in such a positive way, I can hardly put into words how grateful I am. Not only does the company live by their core values, they truly care for the people that work for them. I have had the pleasure of working with some of finest leaders in the industry, who have not only helped me grow professionally but personally as well. Prior to working at WWT, I worked in the financial industry, for another Fortune 500 company, where for 10 years I only felt like a number. At WWT I feel like a valued member of a large family, that continues to grow. Most of my time here has been spent in Operations at LTC, and I feel the leadership here has done a great job balancing the business growth, while maintaining the culture that WWT prides itself on. Not to mention the fact, that the company continues to invest in their employees with the profit sharing, 401K match and incredible insurance. As previously stated, I couldn't be more proud to say that I work for this amazing company and can not thank my leadership teams enough for believing in me and providing me with this opportunity.",That I didn't start my career here at WWT sooner.,"5.0

Leadership - Our Director is someone I admire. He's a good person and the way he leads/treats us is without a doubt the secret sauce to our happiness and success. He lives the culture and it shows in the way he behaves. Culture - I like going to work. I get excited when walking in the door. When I leave, it is not unusual for me to turn around, take a breath, and thank God for WWT and know that I am privileged to work here. Every day isn't sunshine and rainbows. But even on the worst of days, this culture will pull you through if you have the right leadership in place who you know not only care about you as a worker, but as a person as well. Work Life Balance: When you enjoy what you do, it can be very easy to become addicted to your job. This is a double-edged sword. Yes, we work off hours occasionally, but not because we are told to. But because we know it’s needed as our global business is building steam and our friends across the pond need some help. Our Leadership does not ever force us to do this. We do this to support teams who need us and we recognize that. Proud to help! This is always recognized, mentioned, and appreciated by our leadership. Teammates: I work with very knowledgeable people from a Project Management perspective, data, process, and financials. Always willing to enlighten me or educate me and I often do the same for them. These are the type of people you can trust and that you would have over to your families Thanksgiving meal. We succeed together, and we fail together (occasionally). But we learn as a team and we have a great harmony with one another. Not afraid to challenge one another when we need to. We trust each others intent and boy does that speed things up! Our transition into Finance has been relatively seamless from a culture perspective other than noticing how cool Finance is and the great things they are doing from a culture perspective to make my experience working for this company even better! Yes, our insurance is world class. Our 401K is world class.",Much manual work in many processes that increase the risk of errors and issues. We have to be on our toes! Lack of systematic communication within hand offs for important information due to tools not capturing or performing as needed. The business is changing quickly. We have to be agile with our tools and get them updated quickly to meet needs.,"4.0

Wed Mar 13 2019 14:30:46 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Regional Manager,"Charlotte, NC",Former Employee ,The contrast between stated core values and reality is stunning!,I worked at World Wide Technology full-time for less than a year,"- The best benefits I have ever had - I was very well paid - Senior management willing to try new things and willing to be wrong - Just the interest in being a great place to work, lip service to core values, organizational health and no bad managers is a good thing - really great folks work here (to be fair, really great folks work in all places I have worked) -extremely financially successful and willing to invest in real estate and supply chain services. Really an impressive feat - Bonuses in my experience do not have any MBOs applied to them. It is just free money based on your negotiation skills.","- I applied to be an Area Director, I was hired as a Program Director and my job title was Regional Manager. We all like to pretend titles do not matter. They do especially as they indicate career progression. This practice of posting a general role and easing the employee into a lessor role is problematic. - Like no other company in my entire 25 year career have I ever found such a poisonous relationship where sales (one large account I know of, could be others) inflicts its inherent power on the service experts and professionals it relies upon to meet the needs of demands client in agreements outside the four corners of the contract. Instead of a team (who might have disagreements from time to time), the WWT sales team have enlisted their customer in partnership against their own WWT services team in order to extract resources not paid for by the client. To assist in this campaign, the sales team participates and obstructs in the management of each project in a purposeful effort to create chaos and uncertainty in hopes that in the end, they achieve a win on the balance sheet. Blatant character assignation and a willingness to say one thing and do another is a staple of this account team and WWT senior management is either inept or uninterested in addressing this - clearly willing to allow this poison to infect all those employees assigned to deliver for this account. - There is no administration of justice as there is no process or even interest in having such a process. A complaint is voiced, management huddles and a decree is given. The employee has no recourse, no input whether true or not. - Bad managers do work here and there is a community of them powered by the lack of process and enforcement of standards. - Never discourage your employees with providing honest feedback: This wisdom is unknown to the managers this employee is familiar with. Provide your honest feedback and prepare to have this defined as insubordination and an employee performance problem - There is no mechanism or process in place to enforce that WWT is a good place to work and that employees and management adhere to the core values - Even if there was a process, the culture like many companies would likely preserve an account and its account manager despite the lip service to core values ($ over values) - Organization confusion: Professional services has technology practices who are largely known by the field. There is also a delivery organization, a new command center concept that offers field support and Branch services that supports multiple sites cut support. Lastly there is a regional management team responsible for P&L. In smaller less successful organizations, technology practices owned delivery and the services being delivered. Simple for the field, simple contract and minimal redundancy. It drive repeatability and accountability, two things WWT has little grasp on. - Distribution lists are rampant. Maybe different for others but I was automatically signed up for a bunch of these which flooded my inbox with noise from other teams and other projects. Using email in this way has always been a red flag for organizational chaos. - The practice of making things up in order to justify a termination may make sense legally but with ""at will"" employment and at a company who wants to be a great place to work should approach this differently as this practice requires the manager to sacrifice their integrity. - Down time: When I was hired, it took weeks for me to be assigned and only so much into poking around one can do. I was flown to HQ, spent 4 hours in an on boarding meeting, walked around by myself, met my manager but mostly down time. When moving to another internal role, more weeks waiting and once assigned, workload was at best 50% of my capacity. I was getting paid well but nothing saps moral faster than, the level of disorganization all this down time indicates.","1.0

Management: I had the best manager and supervisor I could have asked for in the position I was in when I left(Networking Team @ NAIC2), they never made me feel left out or unheard and the amount of time they were ready to invest into me was amazing. Benefits: I looked into a lot of companies while I was with WWT and I can say with no doubt in my mind that they offer absolutely AMAZING benefits and will be hard to beat no matter where I go. Family oriented: Management makes it very clear that family and health comes first for WWT. Invested: WWT has made it clear that they're invested in your growth as an employee of theirs. They actually LISTEN to their employees no matter the position they're in. Every glass door review they can respond to they do which is pretty awesome.","Management and career growth: This is the absolute most frustrating part of WWT. The position I started in (RNS Team @ NAIC2) there was too many people and not enough management. I got out of that team when they started implementing management into the team more so I know it's gotten better but it was AWFUL when I started. I actually lost out on a higher job opportunity within the company because I was just a ""temp"" and no one bothered to tell me that management had changed and with that my new supervisor pulled the rug out from under me 2 weeks before my start date for the new position even though my old supervisor had approved of everything leading up to me getting into the new position. Sure this may seem to be a one time slip up but when there are multiple people being told they're gonna be transferred to another team just to wait around 10 months and maybe finally get moved once the ""pipeline"" has allowed them to be brought on. Growing pains: I'm gonna jump on the bandwagon here because it's as plain as day that it's a thing happening throughout all of WWT. That being said Corporate has not been quiet and they have talked about it ALOT. So far all the promises they made have been true and implemented (although some slower than others) and hopefully it continues in this direction. Pay: Just because you offer the best benefits around doesn't mean you shouldn't pay your employees close to average market pay. (They were working on this when I left but I had not seen anything implemented yet)","4.0

A lot of the people who work here are amazing people. The company does a lot of cool and thoughtful extras like the holiday parties and GPTW parties. as well as cater Thanksgiving and Christmas lunches.,"In the few years I have worked here the morale has gone from 100% to almost zero. With the recent ban on headphones we (in the lab) feel punished and can see absolutely no logical reason to take that from us. I can say in all honesty that unless you are friends with leadership, you will remain wherever you are. I really felt this was not the case when I first started but I became close friends with my supervisor and it was very obvious that I had started to get ahead of my qualifications because of it. This has since ended but was very eye opening and kind of damaging to the view of leadership. THE PATH that is drilled into our heads is hard to keep at heart when you feel like leadership is constantly lying to you. I did not receive ANY compensation this year while my review I was being told how much of a value to my team I am and to not let it get me down. Even though the PTO system seems like a good idea it does not cover enough time to have time off as well as make sure you have enough time in case you get the flu or something and need like a week off. There is A TON of people throwing people under the bus in order to get where they want to go in the company. All and All we put most of our life at work or getting ready for work or driving to work. I really use to look forward to coming to work everyday but it has become hard to maintain that positive attitude with so much going wrong in the lab. I really feel there is so much more to say but fear these concerns are not looked at as anymore than another upset employee","2.0

If your not friends, or sleeping with someone your not growing period. Leadership will not allow people who have aspirations to something. Its extremely difficult to gain a position on the engineering side of RACK and STACK or anywhere. You are met with more obstacles to even get looked at. If they give you feedback and work on it you are met the following with something stupid like your not qualified when you are. The supervisors are now just adding more onto the leads they have to deal with. Their is one lead that does an extreme amount of work to be met with crap deadlines with no time to provide a great product but wants all of the speed and quality. For example here is x amount of racks here 3 days to completely get it done. Let's just say those racks are more than 8. The best company to work for and grow. Yea ok it's the best company to work for if your not at the itc rack and stack. Any where else is probably the best place but not the naic- St. Louis. The C.I.P. (continuous improvement program) is a joke. You come up with an idea the potentially saved the company millions of dollars a year and all you get is a CHANCE a CHANCE to win a 50 dollar gift. Make it more of an appreciation thing do something like 1 percent of the money the company has saved using your idea. Not a CHANCE to win 50 dollars. Also people who bend over backwards to help and ensure project deadlines are met which is a ton more than you will think. They dont get a chance to do anything more than the low man on the totem pole and all of leaderships friends and people they get brought in and watch them move straight up without even putting time in. Just to be honest I cant even say that I enjoy working here. And I used to be very proud to work here, felt like what I did was valued. Now I know I'm just a number who just has to produce because we have people not even qualified to do the jobs they're in.

This includes pay raises, promotions, ability to move from logistics to the lab, and more. There is also a huge problem with favoritism.

At one moment they are focused to your time to the MINUTE, sending you home at 2:29pm when you leave at 2:30.

Some long term staff have risen while having limited to no experience outside of WWT (not a problem on its surface) but in some cases are then intimidated by those who do - even working to undermine lesser tenured staff to preserve their station. This has the effect of limiting the creativity that comes from diverse perspectives - especially if an outside perspective does not align with the status quo or desired personal agendas of those with political influence. Perhaps this political gamesmanship results from some sense of duty to protect the company from those who may threaten what is believed to be the ""culture"" - possibly not realizing that it is the gamesmanship itself that undermines the core values and leadership principles that could otherwise keep the company at the top of the list of GPTW. And while it could also be that rewarding tenure is an attempt to maintain the family-like feel and culture, other companies manage to do this without turning the org into something of a cult - as has been noted by some who have preceded my departure. And while WWT has the ability to attract very talented staff, it seemingly falters when it comes to maximizing their contributions - largely, in my opinion, due to the challenges listed above. In other cases it’s because their leaders just didn’t know how to utilize them that staff left feeling underutilized.","3.0

Tue Feb 05 2019 21:35:51 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Lab Technician,"Edwardsville, IL",Current Employee ,The Edwardsville Location is Tanking and Nobody Seems to Care,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than a year,"The benefits are great, some people here are good!","I'm still incredulous at how fast management at the Edwardsville LTC (NAIC) location has ravaged the morale. There's been life-changing promises that have been ignored (such as compensation, employee structure changes, and various everyday things that add up). Management will constantly assure ""updates and communication"" only to never follow up. Policies are being issued left right and center that have been confirmed to have no supporting research or evidence by different teams within the company. Promises have been made to fix things months and months ago by the CEO and CFO who visited this location personally, yet a majority of employees have accepted that it was all smoke and mirrors because nothing has happened. I work with many employees on the floor and can personally attest that the most people now have a very low job satisfaction. At least 20% of the conversations I hear, whether I initiated them or not, are about how we all need to find a new place to work, and it hasn't always been like that. I can assume that about once or twice a month, there will be a change in policy that will either take away a harmless freedom I have, add more worthless processes that someone thought was a good idea, or somehow impede my ability to work. The actual workers that these ideas affect have no contribution to the matter and no warning of their arrival. Lunch and breaks are completely inflexible, unless you work in the office. Speaking of which, if you must apply here then apply for an office job because there's recently been a global headphone ban everywhere but in the offices. In the labs which are nearly identical to the office in terms of safety, and where hearing damage is an actual risk due to hours of work by loud servers, headphones are banned but earplugs are allowed... not provided. Request for documentation of studies or research on the ban have been ""charismatically"" batted away by management. There is a very, very strong culture of nepotism. If you've read the reviews here you already know this, but I feel that I need to add a confirmation that at Edwardsville, raises and promotions are granted almost exclusively on a ""buddy basis"". I've personally seen extremely rare personalities and intellectuals get refused a job and not offered any reason as to why. Those positions are filled by friends of the management first. I've seen this a bewildering amount of times. I want it to be known that I'm not simply leaving an angry review, but that I have a factual concern for this location and therefore this company. Things here are really bad, and if something isn't done soon, one would logically predict a huge loss for World Wide Technology. HR, coming from a technician, administer an anonymous survey about management that people can take from home. If you haven't been tapped in to the feel of the location then this can only be beneficial to you. If you have, then I have nothing else to offer. HR will likely respond saying core values are important or that things are being looked into, but I assure you, when you're working here, you'll realize that ""it takes time to look into things"" (a very very long time) and that the core values system is simply a tool that management uses to manipulate the grunts. If you do get a job here, take a nap during orientation because 90 percent of it will be a cultish blast of ""core values"" that will only be a one way street. If HR would walk around and talk to the people on the floor, they would be on red alert. I mean look at the ratings, from 8th to 99th best place to work in a year? from 4.5 average rating to 3.9 in months? There's so many problems with the Edwardsville location that I can't even fully cover everything here. Might as well apply at Walmart, Amazon or any job requiring just a high school education and make very near or more than what entry level makes here minus the drama and corporate nonsense that is forced on you with this job. This location WAS great, but now-a-days I'm embarrassed that I've told people that they should apply here. There's a section for advice to management here, but I HAVE given advice to management. I've voiced my worries as much as I can without emailing HR and am now willing to accept it as a certainty that nobody in management there is bothered by my concerns. So if constant internal emails that aren't replied to or even acknowledged have a zero-sum, then why would one consider this Glassdoor review to have any leverage on the situation? Based on actual conversations, most feel like they have nobody on their side and HR is the last finger holding onto the cliff. If something isn't done soon then, for many, that finger is going to slip.","1.0

Tue Jan 08 2019 15:01:05 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Senior Software Engineer,"Denver, CO",Current Employee ,Fun place to work and a great place to learn,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 3 years,"I've been developing software professionally for almost 18 years now. There are a few positive things about Asynchrony that really set it apart from other jobs I've had. 1. Pair programming - The majority of the time when I'm working I'll pair with another developer. And this is a common arrangement amongst almost all of our teams. I find that this greatly improves ramp up time for a project and allows us to learn from each other faster than we would learn on our own. The code quality improves drastically as you and your partner work together and feed off each other. And last of all it really breaks down knowledge silos so any one of us can leave for vacation with full confidence that the rest of the team will carry on fine without us. 2. TDD - Test-driven development is strongly encouraged and it's refreshing to see. Quality is improved so much with TDD and it's really incredible when it's embraced like this. 3. Agile (kanban) - Our way of agile software development has a way of simplifying my job while also improving our efficiency and even reducing the stress of a big project. 4. Learning - As you work here you'll probably be chosen for projects based on your past experience and existing skills to some extent. But I've seen time and time again people being chosen for a project who were missing the experience on a couple technologies necessary for the project. And yet they're given the chance to learn on the job with the safety net of other experienced developers around them to help. I've been on both ends of this and it's been awesome to learn some new technologies and even teach others in this way. 5. Ping pong - Yes, we have a ping pong table in the Denver office and there are several of us who play almost every day during our lunch break. It's a great way to re-energize before getting back to work.","1. I have heard some people complain about pair programming and that it just doesn't suit them. I think you have to be open to that way of working to really thrive here as a developer. But I still maintain that pair programming is a positive from my perspective. 2. Deadlines - Ultimately most projects are still going to have deadlines. Our agile process helps alleviate a lot of the pitfalls of failing to deliver within your deadline. But deadlines still serve as a stressor for each team at some point. The good news is that as many of our longer-term clients begin to trust us the deadlines are relaxed and we begin to focus with the client more on prioritizing, forecasting, and just simply working the stories most valuable to the client. When this happens our jobs as developers become less compromised as we're able to make better decisions every day without the external pressure of a looming deadline.","5.0

Where to begin? Firstly, a good majority of the ITC/NAIC management doesn’t belong where they are! There are several Supervisors who have that position not because of experience or knowledge, but because they are ""best buds"" with their manager. Secondly the favoritism here is out of control. You only get promotions if you’re the manager or supervisors are your drinking buddy, not if your qualified. I have seen many good employees come and go because of this and it’s a shame. Same can be said about raises, if you’re the supervisors drinking buddy then you get a good review and get an above average raise percentage. Also, I have seen the way supervisors talk to their teams, very poorly, they talk down to them, act like they are stupid or just plain ignore them. I have also seen an employee cry because of a supervisor 3 separate times, never in my life have I seen this, I've worked for some horrible companies and never saw that. Very unprofessional. The core values have become nothing but a joke, management makes us repeat them like parakeets and they don't follow them their self's. I keep seeing replies from HR on here about how to talk to your manager or go a level up or talk to HR rep at the site... That doesn’t work, if you bring it to HRs attention they just brush it off like it’s nothing or they say well we need to coach them up or let them know how we feel. I know of supervisors who have had people go to HR on them several times, how many times are they supposed to get coached up or talked to higher ups before something is done? I no longer believe in the coaching up or coaching out, good concept if you follow through. Many people don’t go to HR or the next level of management or even coach up their supervisors because of fear of retaliation, they say “oh that doesn’t happen” or “we don’t do that”, I’d like to call their bluffs on that, because they will talk down to you or give you horrible reviews and do anything in their power to make your life feel like hell.","1.0

New employees are not fairly recognized for improvements in skills and abilities. They said they were addressing this at a recent meeting, it appears that my expectations were too high. Communication is lacking, wait time for a response to a question or email can be lengthy! Training is poor at best. It is an uphill struggle for entry level employees and there is very little support from management. There is plenty of company sponsored training that comforts the company lawyers. The only company training that I have had in regards to my job is from co workers, some of whom were not overly enthusiastic about this! Managers offer praise, then always include a ""but"". It often seems like there is a rule that requires them to keep looking until they find something wrong. Employees are required to clock in and out for breaks, as adults I'd think that there would be enough trust (on the part of management) and responsibility (on the part of employees) that this wouldn't be necessary. If someone is abusing breaks it is unreasonable to punish everyone! A lot of people are related to each other or are friendly with managers. A lot of these same people are doing very well with the company while others who perform just as well or better are left behind.","3.0

Based on the recent negative reviews, it looks like more of the more accurate or objective reality about working here is starting to appear on this site. Additional evidence is the drop in Glassdoor's rankings from #8 to #99 in just 1 year - from this, one may conclude that either there was major loss of morale over the year or that the years of high ranking were just a fluke and painted an inaccurate picture. I will say that internally, at least in my department, there is pretty much a unanimous understanding that all the ""Great Place to Work"" boasting is nothing but propoganda and I have yet to meet anyone who actually feels that way about WWT. In fact, more than one colleague has expressed to me that had they known the truth about this place, they would never have decided to join. I also feel this way and am currently seeking employment elsewhere. So, as a word of caution to prospective employees, if you have been led to believe (through the Great Place to Work accolades, etc.) that WWT is inherently a superior workplace or something of a holy grail when it comes to employers, I have been in those same shoes and will say that those rose-colored glasses will inevitably come off and you may or may not like what you see when that happens. In my short time here, at least 5 of the best and brightest engineers in the department have voluntarily left. A common thread was that they tended to also be the genuinely nice and agreeable ones. Most of who remain are the opposite. With regards to THE PATH and the No Bad Managers policy, it has been surprising to see that the seemingly straightforward values outlined could be made so open to interpretation by managers especially; words like trust, humility, and integrity seem to mean something different to them than the dictionary definitions, and not in a good way. As history shows, dissenting reviews on this site and more culture policies from HR, although well-intentioned, will not produce meaningful change. So, my only purpose is that those considering employment at WWT will take the hype with a grain of salt and understand that this really is just another workplace- nepotism, politics, behind-closed-doors plotting, favoritism, bad managers, etc. are at WWT just like everywhere else. The major difference is the unbelievable efforts it has taken to accentuate/exaggerate the positive.","1.0

Any job I have worked at where you talk to ur employees like they are replaceable ends with losing good employees and brings morale down. Management has stated if someone isn’t happy with how things are going the door isn’t locked.

Employee development – even though the organization strives for employee development, there are members of leadership who criticize employees’ decisions for wanting to move into new roles.

Pay is below average for the amount of work that is thrust upon and required of GOO.

Operational processes are mind-numbing and not well thought out for long term success – endless spreadsheets, forms, emails, changes, lack of communication/miscommunication, inefficiency, lack of organization.

Lack of accountability - GOO is oftentimes thrown a mess and expected to make it work, while there is little to no accountability for other teams.

Adherence to these core values, however, varies by location and by department. Health Insurance is very competitively priced.","CULTURE Unfortunately, there are many VPs at the company that give only lip service to these corporate values. What is said at ""trust exercises"" is often used against employees by insecure leaders. Almost all of their executives have been with the company for 20 years. Many of them have no significant experience outside of WWT and some are in over their heads as the company experiences rapid growth and the industry experiences transformational change. COMPETITION WWT has not responded decisively to industry transformation that threatens the primary business of selling and installing IT equipment on customer premises such as customers moving more of their IT workload to the cloud. COMPENSATION WWT also has serious compensation equity issues. My peers and I were unable to get adequate increases approved for our top performers, and could not get increases for employees that were promoted until the year-end review cycle. Employees that come in from the outside regularly negotiate compensation packages that are better than existing employees. Leadership is aware but does not address this inequity, and it is obvious to the employees.

Middle management in the NYC Region does not follow the core values at all. Sure, it’s important to make money, that’s why companies exist – but WWT is a company that prided itself on its core values (Trust, Humility, Enthusiasm, Passion, Attitude, Team work and Honesty). I found the NYC region’s middle management lacking in just about every one of these values.

I like my supervisor, and my previous supervisor and management, but the people above them are the wrong people for their positions. The executive team pushes culture and unity in there team, and they reach that goal through the boo ""the Advantage"" by Patrick Lencioni. However, the people below them are not committing to these ideals the Executive team is pushing (and they aren't bad ideals. They are pretty smart). I have read and reread the book and i find myself seeing the culture take hits because they haven't aligned their behavior with what the company wants/needs. They just promoted one of these people to a global level position. This individual has frequently played politics and taken on so many responsibilities, that nothing ever gets done and follow through doesn't exist. I spoke with my supervisor about my concerns about managements decision and the dying culture in our facility, and I was told to keep my opinion to myself. Because if the wrong person hears (my concern, not even fighting against the shift, but personal opinion) then i could easily get black balled and damage my future career with the company. If I can't even share my opinion (which ""The Advantage"" encourages and says is required to maintaining culture and a health organization) means that our culture really is dying, and the wrong people are clearly in the wrong positions. I've personally considered leaving the company several times due to poor management.","3.0

Thu Jul 12 2018 14:42:37 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Manager,"Saint Louis, MO",Current Employee ,When is enough -enough,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 5 years,"The culture beneath executive leadership is unparalleled and truly a “no man left behind” mentality. The co-founder of the company started WWT with real values that he left written for us to follow. The delivery teams display these values day in and day out. These teams dedicate long nights, weekends, and holidays to provide the best customer satisfaction and truly exemplify what THE PATH is all about. It is dis-heartening to admit this dedication is now being threatened.","Why is this dedication being threatened? Example 1: A PC has been working at WWT for 4 years and performing at Program Manager Level with the true character of a leader. This PC has taken on a hard ball banking company project without a pay raise and no hope of one in the near future. There is a large gap between associating promotions with pay raises; minor bumps in pay to reward for extra effort need VP approval. Example 2: A PM is now graded on performance for the project financials which involves a deduction in pay, pay that was initially agreed upon when hired. An Engineer is governed (at VP level) to keep utilization high, which concludes that efficiency for any tasks will work against him/her. It is in the best interest of the engineer to keep their utilization high, which consequently supports non-efficient, billable hours to maintain that high utilization rather than be cost efficient on a project and save money for WWT as a whole. These same hours affect the PM's grading performance on financials that will ultimately deduct their pay. In conclusion, Engineers are not seen as busy unless they bill hours to prove they are being utilized. So why would an engineer want to be efficient at a job? At the risk of compromising their utilization and losing their job it is difficult to say. Example 3: An Engineer Manager not being able to conduct interviews since all candidates must be interviewed by the VP. The EM knows more about the expectations of the customers and does not even get to provide input since the choice is at the sole discretion of the VP. A PMO manager who is not able to get assistance for his/her team to relieve PMs because any new hires must have VP approval. The PMO was tasked with governance, VP level request, on an audit process that was not fully baked however became a mandatory requirement, which continually changes and uses up non-billable time. PMs spend 45% of their time on processes and governance- which includes reporting Risks and status reports on 3 different platforms- Yet, PMs are showing a low utilization. Example 4: An office space performing multi-site deployments, made for 54 people is now occupying 70 and running 24/7. Employees sit too close to each other, which makes conference calls near impossible. There is still no approval to obtain a bigger space, since, you guessed it, only the VP can approve.","2.0

WWT has fun events like the Xmas party, Cardinals/Blues games, happy hours, team outings, etc. Love this part of the culture, this social experience with co-workers truly cultivates such a unique and healthy work environment. Huge benefit to this company is the health benefits - I have very bad knees and am undergoing some extensive surgeries and can't even begin to tell you how often I hear providers mention how outstanding our coverage is. A lot of people argue that they'd like to make more (who wouldn't), but I truly hope that is never made a priority via downgrading the extent of this benefit. Also, if the cost of insurance rises with our salaries, then we're really not gaining anything!","Sometimes we are overworked and it can be difficult to have a work/life balance, but I believe this is a struggle in most companies that aim to keep the headcount down and the value high.

The company is undergoing a new business process mindset that is going to be awesome and are leaning on those folks who have had 10+ years experience, not the new hires.

Middle managers hired in some cases, not all, are green with very little professional services field experience (as architects/engineers) that manage architects and engineers in the field that are rock stars. I have seen this first hand. This is disconcerting. Favoritism, nepotism and the good old boy mentality is very evident. Field services engineers are viewed as ""resources"" (nothing more) with little chance of advancement if they are contributing as rockstars in the field. Pidgeon holed so to speak. Advancement to higher level positions is hired externally, not developed. This has to change or WWT will lose the rockstars that bring in the revenue now and make the company shine. This group is invaluable as the future WWT leaders and with the right grooming should be given every opportunity to advance their careers through what I call ""developing budding prospects in the farm system"". Instead, these opportunities seem to be hired out externally. I am somewhat disappointed that senior leadership has not seen this trend. It's real. Is this practice acceptable? If I have one ask, it is that senior leadership recognize the talent that is helping WWT grow and move towards the path of transitioning from a good company to a great company by moving the needle a bit in the favor of those that have earned a shot.","3.0

Flexibility, able to work from home","This company is not what I thought it would be. The longer you work here, the more you see the flaws. 
1) Nepotism 
2) Pay is low
3) Frivolous spending
Nepotism needs to be addressed - in no way should a sister report to her brother, or a sister report to her sister, etc. An org. shake up needs to be done. Also, too many new hires have executive connections. 
Pay is low, and there is no good way to get a bump in your salary. If you think you'll increase your pay by moving to a different position, think again. You will continuously move laterally. So, you will end up doing more work with the same amount of pay. 
Company really should scale back on frivolous spending. There are departments that really could use additional head count and can't get the people they need. As the company tightens up on hiring, it doesn't appear to tighten up on unnecessary spending.","2.0

I have noticed that in one of the departments the manager has influence and power over three of the individuals that report directly to her. Of the small group of individuals that report to her, one is her sister, one is her cousin and one is her best friend. I'm afraid the manager for this work group is giving preferential treatment to these individuals and not adhering the the companies great policies. It's already hard enough to obtain employment in the Phoenix office without having to be directly related to someone in that group.","4.0

Fri Mar 09 2018 12:08:56 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Saint Louis, MO",Current Employee ,Feedback w/ Honesty and Integrity,I have been working at World Wide Technology full-time for more than 10 years,"1. Flexibility with work schedule. 2. Good benefits and very reasonable insurance. 3. Focus on building a positive culture internally. 4. Ability to get very creative and think outside the box. You can typically create your own schedule (within reason) and work on things that play off your strengths. 5. ""On your honor"" training opportunities available through online programs. 6. Due to the startup-vibe and fast-paced growth of the company, there are many opportunities for one to make their own path and even create a new role that may not currently exist. 7. Work-life balance is pretty great, although it does vary by role. Pre-sales roles tend to have the most balance, and operations and PS roles have the least - but in general it seems to be greater than other corporations in the same class.","Anyone who tells you any company has no cons is withholding some truth - even the best have room for improvements. The aim of this review is to both be helpful to potential candidates while also being constructive to internal decision makers. 1. Training: Currently the company is growing so fast that it is difficult to keep up with training new hires, which promotes a sink or swim mentality. Even roles that have existing work instructions typically haven't kept up with the times and those instructions are out of date or no longer relevant due to the ever-changing and growing environment. 2. Interview Process: Hiring process is rigorous and longwinded. Intentions are good, as this in an attempt to appropriately weed out non-culture fits. Unfortunately, sometimes the process can backfire as it may take months, therefore, potentially losing interest from high quality candidates that don't have the option to wait in the wings for a job. 3. Termination process: While fireable offenses are handled in a timely and appropriate manner, non-culture fits and indolent employees tend stick around a long time. WWT will try its best to find you the right seat on the bus - which is a very good concept and what I would consider a ""pro"" - however, in practice it sometimes leads to poor work ethic sticking around, and being passed around for years before the unfit employee typically decides to leave on their own terms. 4. Salary: While insurance benefits are fantastic - the savings are reflected in a much lower salary than industry averages. WWT also does not put a monetary focus on long term employees salary increases - you're better off leaving and coming back to gain a reasonable bump (which dozens of employees have done). Definitely negotiate a strong salary upfront or risk falling behind the curve. 5. Open Door Policy is Hit or Miss: Open door policy is something the company places into its core values - however this is something that is quite hit or miss depending on the department. Some doors are wide open where others are very difficult to gain access to. 6. Inexperienced upper management (for a large business): One of the best parts about WWT is the fact that a lot of the original executives are still around. The downfall of this, however, is that none of them have ever run a large business. There will need to be a certain point when it might be beneficial to tap into a business leader with tenure at a large organization to step in and help consult on some of the growth issues around processes and expansion - especially in the international realm. 7. Internal User Collaboration Tools & Applications: There is an obsession, especially within the Unified Communications team, in touting whatever applications they deem to be the ""latest and greatest"" for internal communication and collaboration. This actually hinders progress and productivity as employees constantly have to re-learn how to use new tools, or learn to be well versed in multiple applications that all do similar things. Efficiency comes from mandating tools and processes so that everyone is on an even playing field. 8. Headquarters vs the World: The culture at headquarters is fairly amazing, and could be considered the poster child for the culture desired for the rest of the corporation. Unfortunately its hard for a lot of the remote and non-STL-based employees to understand what makes WWT such a differentiator in certain aspects because a lot of the benefits are HQ-centric. Its also tough to scale our Midwestern culture on a global scale. All in all, the company is currently facing a lot of issues that most small businesses have when transitioning into a much larger corporation. It's still a relatively good place to work, however. Like any fast growing company there are kinks to be worked out, and WWT, for the most part, continues to try and improve and doesn't remain complacent.","4.0

It started out as a relaxed place where so long as you were diligent and didn't waste time, you were treated with respect as an employee and a person. Management has become dead-set on destroying that, going out of their way to insure they control their employees as much as possible to flex their egos. They constantly spout the core values, yet never adhere to them. The very rules they enforce on employees are then openly broken by management, or their favorites, with no punishment. They will find any excuse to keep an employee down and lower their raise to a few pennies. Some managers have even lied about their employees, intentionally preventing them from advancing their careers so said employees stay working in the lab under that manager's thumb. Even managers who have been previously written up and booted out of other departments get free reign here, able to throw as many people under the bus as they can for their own careers. There are a maximum of 2-3 decent, competent people in management. Everyone else is a bully going on a powertrip with no end in sight. I don't know if HQ will ever do anything about this situation at this point, but when they do it will be too little, too late. World Wide Technology is a great company as a whole, but this is somehow the worst of it all concentrated in one area.","1.0

Credit the executive team and some visionary leadership from key personnel to diversify the business and create a unique end to end service offering for Systems Integration. No one can even come close to what WWT has. Culture is the real deal for the most part. Of course when you get to 5K employees you cant have perfection but it is way above par. The executive team emphasizes culture daily and i feel does all it can to preserve and foster good people and a great work environment.,1. Pay is low to average. 2. No real opportunities for advancement or at least merit based advancement. You still have to know someone. 3. HQ centric. You have to work in St. Louis to really enjoy the great place to work benefits. No special consideration for remote employees. 4. Some divisions are run by long time employees and it is obvious the company has outgrown their management ability. Lots of nepitism. Lack of trust. This makes promotion difficult or downright impossible. 5. Internal communication and processes are downright immature and frankly terrible. So many tools and no one uses them or don't know how. This is probably my only real complaint. A file management plan consistently enforced down to each employee with a quality search engine that actaully can find things would be just termendous to making life easier for existing and new personnel. 6. Training programs are poor. Well it actually doesnt exist for almost any position in the company. It is person to person transfer and new people just have to stumble along for months until they just figure things out.,"5.0

I was asked by the site to edit my previous review after having been responded to by the WWT HR staff, only to find it was no longer posted, nor were the reviews I noted to support my statements available. Which is fine and just proves my point. You can look through the interview reviews and see similar examples. There is limited opportunity for advancement as well due to the ongoing philosophy of outsourcing leadership rather than grooming from within. Many outstanding associates have left as they watched leadership get hired externally while they were passed over.

It could be the toughest day, and I have no idea if I am winning. Through even this, I can smile and have a great attitude because I work for WWT (truly a great place to work). The support of our teams and leadership makes a tough day be OKAY. Please, understand this is not every day that is tough, but it is those days of all I am reminded truly how lucky I am to be a part of WWT. Our culture is truly an inspiration. It provides a great workplace environment and atmosphere where people are respectful of one another and driven to make WWT successful. The right people are genuine and are our culture. The benefits are outstanding. Our insurance has not increased in YEARS! Our coverage is fantastic and we have on-site medical facilities to support us and our family members covered (NO COST)! Maternity leave has been extended recently which is also great and appreciated. PTO is fabulous of course. Outside of medical and PTO, FLEXIBILITY is a huge benefit! Telecommuting is huge benefit! I am certain I am missing something... too many to list (which is a great thing). WWT is very innovative meaning we are constantly putting our minds together to drive continuous improvement and act on the future. In any role, you can drive change in our company which is absolutely fantastic. I know my ideas mean something and I can make them something. I can bring them to life at WWT! Anyone can do it and is highly encouraged to do so. Even a small improvement you created can have so much value added to our business , and sometimes, the smallest improvements have the greatest impacts. Our facilities are also designed to help spark creativity and motivation. They are clean, up to date, and unique compared to many other organizations. Growth! Everyone loves and needs growth. What better way to measure the success of our organization than to see the year over year growth we have between organic and new business, people, and facilities across the globe! It is incredible, and yes, inevitably growing pains can be experienced, however, it is nothing of the sort that we at WWT cannot handle! #WWTSTRONG","N/A. Thank my lucky stars each night for WWT. I rated ""Work/Life Balance"" 4/5 stars, because we have to do what we need to do to make WWT successful. If this means working late here and there, then perfectly fine. I signed up for it when I signed my offer letter, because I dedicated myself to do whatever it takes.","5.0

The strides that management is taking to set individuals up for success and allow learning from setbacks is beyond anything that I have previously experienced. Individuals have a career path based off of performance, are openly given career advice, and are more than willing to help each other out. Chester G. and Jason D. genuinely welcomed me to this team, and through these seemingly insignificant interactions, I am humbled and even more grateful for this opportunity.","There are areas of the business that do need work. Some have taken advantage their senior positions to only promote those within their social circle. While some may argue this as false, this is the perception of myself, many others, and can be backed with data. Good employees are looked over, leave, or are overworked. It is through inattention to results, that the business and culture have suffered. Often blame is placed elsewhere such as the customer, volume, or an individual is made to be the scapegoat. It does hurt the heart of individuals that have a true passion for this company and see the potential of how great this location could be.","4.0

The reason why most of us are here, have stayed here or even left and come back is because of the people! WWT definitely has a family feel. Also, the flexibility that WWT offers is why a lot of people (especially moms) are here. Its so hard to find a company that understands that work/family/life balance. WWT has found that. I thank senior management for that. WWT puts focus on who they hire and with that, gives you the autonomy and trust to do you job. It makes work not feel so much like work.

No company is perfect but wwt is the golden standard of how close you can get. Most companies advertise family values, open doors, and opportunity.

Your not a number, your family, personal life, hardships, ideas, they all matter from bottom to top of the payroll. Besides the people, my favorite pro to this job is the equality. If you see something being done wrong it doesn't matter if it's your Co worker or boss, you will not get in trouble for speaking out.","I only have two complaints. The training for new employees needs to be much better. The company is working on it and improvements have been made. Still work to do.

Many companies tout their core values and use them as talking points, but they generally end up being nothing more than rhetoric and wall decor. Not at World Wide Technology. At WWT they are a way of life. From the executive leadership team down to the custodial staff, every employee is important and is made to feel that way. The company's core values are talked about on a daily basis and far more often than the company's profits. It's very inspiring to work under a leadership team and in a department that understands that you can accomplish some amazing things when you manage the business with your head, and manage the people with your heart.","Growing Pains - Much more of a challenge than a ""Con"" as I'm sure it's an issue that every company on Glassdoor would love to have. Due to the enormous growth in business, there have been some difficulties with scalability, both logistically and in capacity. Several plans are already in the works to mitigate this and I'm confident these challenges will be short-term.","5.0

When you make a mistake or screw up something they don't point the finger they use that as opportunity to teach and encourage you, that's totally different from most companies I work for.","There are 2 things that I would consider downsides, first, although supervisors and upper management are nice I find that a lot of the co-workers that I work around on a daily basis are not very hospitable. People will walk past and make eye contact and very rarely speak to you. This is nothing big but just something I notice about a lot, not all of the people I see on a daily basis. Number 2 downside is that I don't think the pay is up to par with this industry. We've doubled and maybe even tripled production over the 2 years since I been here but haven't seen any compensation in the form of increase in pay for the increase in workload. I feel there should be some form of payrate increase with performance reviews with if not just simple periodic pay raises just for time put into the company. Yes you get a little bit of a raise if you change positions but oftentimes that decreases your workload, the people building and wiring the racks are the ones who put in all the hours and time and should be compensated for increasing revenue for the company whether they get another position or not.","4.0

Technology is exploding and this company is taking full advantage. WWT has a solid customer base and I expect them to be around for a long time. Great health benefits.,"Leadership. Unfortunately, the management here does not lead. Supervisors and senior management come from friendship rings. They are in desperate need of true leaders, not management, with business knowledge. Process management. This reflects back to the lack of leadership knowledge. We need a better process for almost everything. You have the wild west in LTC. One manager/sup wants it done one way, the next does it another way. This leads to confusion and headaches. No help to build your career. Again, going back to leadership. If you are not looking or already good friends with management forget about a career path. There is little to no career coaching or advancement. Pay structure. Pay is low. Others along with myself truly feel underpaid.","3.0

Strong willingness to invest in technical resources.,"Core values are preached inside the walls on a daily basis, but as the years have passed and as the company has gotten larger, those values are ignored more and more. It seems more evident that the values are followed and mentioned when it is convenient, but not when it actually matters and a true business or personnel decision needs to be made. Company needs to pay more attention to the culture in the field offices and not just HQ. If you are not at HQ on a permanent basis, or a part of that ""click"" it is very difficult to advance as there is definitely favoritism and more loyalty paid to those from STL as opposed to those in the field. With respect to diversity, I personally do not see how we can claim being a diverse company, as from my point of view it is one of the least diverse companies I have seen or work with. There are a number of females in the company, but that is about it. Outside of that, it is shockingly bad. It was most evident to me at this past leadership meeting as well as the last operations meeting. Pictures that were posted from both those meetings should have been evidence that the company needs to diversify more. Especially in its leadership.","3.0
