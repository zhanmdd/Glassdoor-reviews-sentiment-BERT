Thu Dec 26 2019 21:47:01 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Southlake, TX",Former Employee ,BIGGEST REGRET OF MY CAREER is going to work for Sabre.,I worked at Sabre full-time for more than a year,"Sean Menke has a grand vision for transforming the company, and he has not been afraid to make changes to his leadership team. There are still has people that are not respected or trusted in critical positions, but hopefully Sean will continue to make changes.","I saw multiple red flags before being talked into joining Sabre, but I bought into the hard-sell that the recently revamped executive team’s main priority was to change the negative culture and company reputation. It was a huge mistake to believe the hype - it’s just a sales pitch, it wasn’t reality! The instability and chaos of constant changes throughout the company feeds the continual fear of whether people are going to lose their job. It is the only company over my career that I would say has a “toxic” environment. Resistance to change: It got old hearing “that’s the Sabre way” as an excuse for blocking changes that will enable the transformation that Sean Menke (CEO) and 1-2 innovative executives are trying to make. The harsh reality is that many do not support change, nor do they want employees who are courageous to recommend and pursue real change. Instead, I observed the employees who challenged the status-quo or tried to implement new ways of doing things consistently left the company within a short period of doing so (either voluntarily or were “laid-off”). Multiple lay-offs each year continue to be the norm: A common phrase I heard was “you have to stay under the radar if you want to survive the next round of reduction-in-force roulette” - which I now agree is true. I personally observed 5 different rounds of “realignments” in less than 2 years where groups of people were laid off (realignment is considered a more “friendly” term so they don’t use the term “lay-off”). A VP said in a meeting that lay-offs are an expected norm in business! The leadership clearly doesn’t have the “business acumen” to figure out how to avoid laying-off people when they have hundreds of job openings at the same time. Multiple “Reorganizations” every 6-12 months: It has been “the Sabre way” over the last few years to reorganize once or twice a year. As a result of the frequent reorganizations and realignments (lay-offs) employees rarely have the same manager for more than a year. I personally experienced 2 reorganizations and reported to 3 different people in 1.5 years. My hiring manager had 3 different managers within the first 4-months at Sabre! The longest amount of time any of my team members had any manager was just over 1 year (one co-worker had 14 managers in 9 years). Mediocrity wins: What I observed in my area was the people who remain employed are those who “go along to get along.” Strong, progressive, innovative, creative people are not tolerated at Sabre, so they leave as quickly as they can or are pushed out by others trying to protect their own job. Trying to improve and advance the company is just beating your head against the wall day after day. I wish I would have read everything that is available or talked to an employee (not involved in the hiring process) before I joined Sabre, to be informed of how Sabre actually treats people. The signs were there - I wish I had trusted my instincts to pay attention not only to what they were saying, but also to what they clearly weren’t saying!","1.0

Wed Oct 24 2018 04:48:44 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,Daily chaos,I have been working at Sabre full-time,* Remote work is typical/normalized * Choice of company-issued PC or Mac * Tooling is largely up to personal preferences * They will probably still be in business for the foreseeable future due to sheer mass & momentum * Work with people around the world,"You will drown in a sea of redundant systems & processes which are inconsistently implemented/enforced: * 4 distinct communication solutions at one point, some official, others less so * 5 systems/channels for every routine task/project “management”/time-tracking, including email, email with tables, emailed Excel spreadsheets, shared Excel spreadsheets (on a SharePoint system that is inaccessible remotely while connected to their own developer VPN/proxy config), a ticket system not designed/configured for software development, poorly-managed time tracking solution that occasionally doesn’t have your project codes (also inaccessible remotely while connected to VPN/proxy necessary for conducting development tasks, but even as a full-time salaried employee you will be expected to log 8 hours of something every day regardless; you know how on Lost they had to enter numbers on a computer for no apparent reason or bad things would happen? Same thing.) Testing/QA/UAT is probably the sales & support people. But that weekly release still better be immaculate or there’ll be hell to pay if an “emergency” release is necessary. The signal-to-noise level is incredibly bad: * meetings and events could easily absorb a significant portion of your week if you let them Offshore contractors who can vary wildly in technical proficiency, English fluency, and internet connection quality, and who can appear on your team with little to no warning then disappear just as suddenly with their tasks/code left incomplete and no replacement resource in sight. You will be directly and actively made to feel guilty about them having meetings late at into their night even though the company headquartered in Texas is the one who hired them and put you on a team with them with no resources to accomplish asynchronous collaboration. Base pay is mediocre. Benefits are just adequate though expensive for such a large employer. Churn (departures/shuffling) at the higher levels is nearly constant, resulting in a lack of consistent, coherent vision being maintained, leading to sense of instability, discontinuity, and a compensatory discontent among the rank & file. If you have any shred of self-worth, you will become demoralized and possibly even be railroaded out. I watched it happen then experienced it firsthand. The Sabre “values” drum is beat hard and often, but the only thing that is demonstrably valued is unquestioning compliance.","2.0

They trust you will be adult and not wear a shirt with profanity or daisy dukes instead of capris. They told me to just be comfortable. Work from home: WFH policy is causal depending on your manager. They have people that work from home or out of town and come in once a week or once a month. They are more focused with the results of you doing your job than micromanaging your location. Everyone only has laptops. You can take them anywhere and work from the lobby lounge area if you need. Volunteering: Twice a year we have a pet adoption day. The local animal shelter comes out to our location with cats & dogs during the work day and we try to adopt out and also raise money through raffles and bake sales. You can volunteer for various shifts to love on kittens or walk dogs. On top of the average PTO/Sick time they have 16 hours of Community Volunteer time. You can go volunteer at your kid's school, boy scouts, non-profit, church, etc, and get paid without having to dip into your PTO. Recycling: Sabre is very environmental conscience. They don't just 'say' that. There are NO trash cans at people's desk. At all corners and break rooms they have bins for Landfill/Compost/Recycle. The cups and cutlery are all compostable. They have boxes on every floor to recycle pens. A recycle your Keurig cups by every Keuirg machine and they have a huge bin to recycle electronics.",They have random layoffs instead of redirecting efforts of employees.

There's no shortage of demand for UX there. - Decent pay and benefits,"I can't honestly recommend Sabre anymore as a place to work. I could have said that a year ago, but that's no longer the case. The reasons are many: - Deadlines are horribly aggressive. There's a fear that if you don't make them, you'll either be scapegoated or targeted for layoffs. - UX Designers are seen as a means to an end. They used to care about our goals and professional careers, but not anymore. Now we're just used for business initiatives or whatever emergency comes up. We're not even part of product development. it's all short-term and putting out fires. - UX Leadership has favorites that they value more than others. A handful of people were sent to training last year and they were paraded in front of everyone. It was so disrespectful. - There's an 'in' crowd here. You either have extreme loyalty to that in-crowd or you're just seen as production. I heard someone say its a 'UX Mafia'. - A lot of what I read online about UX is not being done here. Whatever 'design thinking' stuff that's being promoted by leadership isn't amounting to much of anything for designers. - Some of my colleagues do not know how to design or do research.

If you are looking for a company that truly cares about their employees' well-being, then you have come to the right place! Below are a list of great things the company has to offer *I don't know about other departments at SABRE, but at the Contact Center, there is a lot of room for growth. In fact, if you apply for a leadership position and do not get the job, you will be told why you were not selected and what you could do to improve your chances at moving up in the future. *The health insurance is amazing and it literally covers just about anything! Depending on which health insurance plan you elect, the deductible is between $2,500 and $2,750 for each covered individual, but the maximum out-of-pocket is $6,500 for each individual - no matter which plan you elect. To cover me and my wife, I pay about $99.00 each check, but that is because I chose the Balanced Choice Plan and the deductible only has to be met at hospitals...unlike most plans that make you meet the deductible for mostly every single type of service. When I go to an in-network doctor, specialist, or urgent care facility, I only pay a copay and that's it.

Wed Sep 06 2017 21:33:00 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Southlake, TX"," in Southlake, TX",Airline Solutions,I worked at Sabre,"These are the pros and cons of working on each area in Sabre: Sales : You have license to be as rude and arrogant as you want. You can over-promise and nothing will come back to you (no accountability). Low stress and enough budget to entertain customers. Plenty of travel. Cons: Contract, addendums, product descriptions, brochures, demos etc… are not your responsibility. These are own by the Marketing organization. Good luck getting quality from them. Marketing and Solutions Management : This organization is understaffed. Grossly understaffed. So it’s not likely that the multiple lay-offs will affect you. Cons: Everything else. You are told that you are the “CEO of your product” but in reality you are the janitor of your product. You work all day and all night. You have to keep apologizing to the customer. You never have enough budget to make a decent product. You have to support the Sales organization and Customer Care, so you become as tactical and short-term as possible. You are dragged by the weight of your development team. Development : You can get two promotions per year. Your salary is good. You provide your own estimates and nobody is smart enough to challenge them. Also zero accountability. You can change your mind in the middle of a development and overrun your project. No worries. Not your fault. Cons: You are a line item in a cost spreadsheet. So if the product runs out of budget you are the first to be laid off. You may be a contractor here. If that’s the case you may take forced vacation by the end of the year. PMO : You can work from home 5 days per week and nobody will notice. Cons: You are not really a Project Manager in the sense of planning an executing. In fact your only role is to do multiple “reports” for upper management and chase people up to request status. You are like a pit-bull and your boss will tell you to keep on biting every day. For the people doing the work you are just a nag. Delivery : You get to learn from the customer first hand. When implementing a new product you learn a great deal about its functionality and the problems of the industry. Cons: Since most products are half-baked your interactions with customers are harsh. If you are an idiot (not uncommon) you’ll bring back that bad vibe into the company. You’ll be mean and fight with the rest of Sabre just to fulfill the whims of a small airline. Everyone will hate you for being mean.","The problem with Sabre is very simple: overpromise. Back when the company went public, the promise to stake holders was a YoY growth that is very aggressive. That number is not achievable. The clowns responsible for that mess have cashed out and are millionaires now. Today the new executive team is unable to grow the business to that expectation. So they have surrendered control to the finance organization and the only thing they know is to cut costs in a desperate attempt to meet target numbers (hence the multiple lay-offs per year).","1.0

Was part of a great team that made it fun and enjoyable. Product team and development worked very well together before all the key resources left. Dedicated team members.,"Poor executive leadership in dealing with transformation. Turned the company to a profit, but lost all the knowledge and skill set in the wake. Great ideas that are poorly executed because not staffed to succeed. Company does not know how to manage new and leading products. Killed Travelocity, Getthere, Meetings, and anything else consumer facing. Give them time and they will mismanage Tripcase.","2.0

Sat May 21 2016 10:05:46 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,, ,Extremely poor management,I worked at Sabre,"Nice covered parking, although the cafeteria is good and well situated, I doubt that it is subsidized by Sabre and it's very over priced.","I have worked as a project consultant for 10 years, Verizon, Pepsi Co, Ericsson, A T & T, I have never seen either managers or directors who are as clueless as those at Sabre. In my group, everyone of the managers and director spent at least 4.5 days all day in meetings, very little visibility or guidance for either the employees or the consultants. Literally hundreds of contractors, the main reason being cost, ergo, Sabre wants cheap contractors. We were originally brought in for a 6 month contract, supposedly very high visibility, then it's cut to 4 months, then two. The managers expect you to put in no more than 40 hours, however if they schedule a late meeting they expect you to not charge them for the meeting. In a few discussions with the employees of the unit none them have any respect for the current managers or the director and the only reason they stay is the money is decent and they can work from home a few days week, sad reasons to stay with a company.","1.0

Negotiate WELL during your hire as you may never see an increase. The culture has turned to fear since former CEO Sam G's departure - he is greatly missed. Prepare to work to an ""outstanding"" level just to get a successful annual rating in certain business divisions. New executive team has refreshing goals but not certain I see a positive future for what was an otherwise incredible company for which I was so proud & happy to be employed. Under cost-cutting measures and prior to IPO, it was interesting watching so many experienced folks get let go two years ago while at the same time, interns walked out the door often with prizes such as flat-screen TVs and computers.","3.0

Fri Jan 22 2016 10:30:19 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Southlake, TX","Product Owner in Southlake, TX",Ok decent pay and competitive benefits but lots of change and churn,I have been working at Sabre,Good PTO but only if you have seniority. Not good for new employees. Not very employee oriented but getting better. Lots of internal opportunities and room for growth. But you have to do it on your own because management is so busy they have no time to spend on employee development. Compensation is market average not bad but not the best. Rest of benefits again are market average. Opportunity to work remotely depending on working group and management disgression but in general pretty flexible from my experience.,"Too many layers of bureaucracy takes forever to get things approved and done which is one reason Sabre has a hard time being a market leader. Conflicting ideals among upper management is another reason it takes longer to get things done. Also there's been a big influx especially in upper management of people with no airline experience. While admittedly hard to find these days these folks don't know the business well but are making decisions for the company. One often wonders if the company is going in the right direction but depends on the silo. One Sabre is a myth. There are so many conflicting and overlapping goals and priorities and upper management trying to hold on to their kingdoms. It's primarily the lower level employees that are working long hours and getting the work done and out the door. Sabre tends to hire people that are good speakers but don't know anything about the business. They are able to fake there way through it like they know what they are talking about but only because the people hiring them don't know either so they think it sounds good so they get hired or promoted. MBA's get a lot of the opportunities again but they know nothing about the business. This company promotes based on number of degrees you have not based on experience.Lots of internal opportunities and room for growth. But you have to do it on your own because management is so busy they have no time to spend on employee development. Thus a lot of people shifting around to different jobs within the company because you rarely get promoted by management.Lots of churn within the company with new upper management, new processes and tools. All to make the company a better place to work so hopefully in the end it will all work out.","3.0
