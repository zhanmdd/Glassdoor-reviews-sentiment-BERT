Fri Jul 10 2020 16:10:06 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,, ,Great place to work. Cisco needs more software companies like Appd,I have been working at AppDynamics,Appdynamics has a great startup culture and STELLAR sales team. Probably the best sales team in the world. Great for learning and great for advancement,"The integration into Cisco was a little bumpy. An actual pro would be that you have a huge engine like Cisco behind you but Cisco can be a little “old world” thinking. The sales team at Cisco is bloated and tired. There are only a few shining stars so It’s sometimes a difficult union. Under appdynamics,, pay increases were better but Cisco is super super stingy when it comes to pay and stock. The hardware side is an easy sale. They have not really grasped that the software side is a different animal. Ive now been pulled into the Cusco machine where meetings are about throwing 20 things at a customer to see what sticks without any planning. companies like amazon, google, Microsoft (you name it) throw stock at employees to keep the talent ... Cisco doesn’t seem to care and has never learned from other tech companies. talent easily fades away. If they ever figure this out they will be an amazing company.","4.0

It was an issue at both of my previous tech companies so its nice to not have to leave your morals at the door.","-We've slowly gotten less perks over the years as Cisco tries to control some of the costs associated with a startup culture.

I have worked at this company awhile and have made lifelong friends. There is a relatively new leadership team, and having worked with many of them for years, I am super excited about the future - most of them were promoted from the trenches and therefore actually know what the state of the business is, where the problems are and how to fix them. Leaders heavily support internal/lateral transfers. There is a lot of emphasis on empowering teams - leadership working with the teams to establish the desired outcomes for the company and then trusting their teams to figure out how to get there, what activities and deliverables are required.","While we're allowed to run relatively autonomously from Cisco, there have been the occasional friction points, but with Covid19, we are now really reaping the benefits of working for a large company like Cisco - deeply experienced leaders who have been through economic downturns multiple times and who are focusing on how to help communities and employees, having enough cash (tens of billions of dollars) to call a total hiatus on layoffs, having an entire team dedicated not only to disasters but specifically pandemics, continuing to hire, etc.","5.0

The great has far outweighed our challenges and much of that is because of the people. Quite simply, good people come and go, but a quality company like AppD(and Cisco) tends to attract some of the best. This means that you're very infrequently the ""smartest"" person in the room and there is incredible opportunity for growth personally and professionally. There are very few days that go by where I am not learning something new or watching people blossom here. That just does not happen at every job and it's something I appreciate greatly! Additionally, while the people are great and one of the reasons I've stuck around, I'm still here mainly because the software works. On the sales side, I've listened to stories of and experienced working for companies that had subpar offerings. They are hard to believe in and it's really hard to sell when you don't believe in the core component of your job. On a weekly basis, I get to see us solve business critical problems that our competition just can't. Trust me when I say that drives you to get the message out and help your customers. Finally, the acquisition by Cisco has worked out very well. They have a very people first approach across the board which is great (especially during the interesting times with COVID19). I glad to be working for a company that has an appreciation for their talent.","You will work, a lot.

He forced her off the team to a different role that was not related to her desired and successful career track, causing her a lot if distress, ultimately leading to her resignation. She was pressured by him to not attend company events, be in HQ the same time as him, etc. Throughout this time, he was very vocal to the rest of team abut his intentions and bragged about his ""accomplishment"". He intimidated other team members to keep quiet and even lied to HR about the relationship dates as to appear he was following protocol, even though he was with her way before he reported it. This issue has caused a lot of morale issues on our team as this was flaunted right in front of us, causing many of us to quit or start considering quitting. This was reported to HR by her with no actions taken by the company. I resigned yesterday and reported this as well, but I'm skeptical any actions will be taken. Once the Director and his boss caught wind of me talking to HR, they had me walked out of the building by HR, even though I still had a week left. That's what over 5 years of dedicated service to AppDynamics gets you. It's clear that this kind of behavior, especially in this cultural climate, is inexcusable. AppDynamics cares more about sales numbers than doing what is right by its employees, especially ones with limited power. This is not only gender discrimination, but also shows a clear lack of integrity by a company who consistently advertises their focus on culture, diversity, and woman in technology. It's no wonder there aren't more woman working in tech.","1.0

With that being said, there are very few companies where you can say that you are working with the best, have an amazing set of solutions to sell, and that every day you learn and are pushed to the next level by your peers. I had that experience at Mercury Interactive and when I left I once felt that I would be spending the rest of my career searching for that again. Until I found AppDynamics. AppDynamics is truly a special place with a team atmosphere and has some of the best of the best people and solutions you will ever work with. I have never worked harder, learned more, or had more success than I have here. We have a world class sales process that if followed properly proves to our customers the amazing value of our solutions and drives that value after the sale to assure satisfaction and growth of the solution and its usage. We have an excellent engineering and product management staff that focuses on delivering high quality solutions that customers need. Even Cisco's acquisition of AppDynamics, which I was concerned could quickly become a negative, has actually turned into a great positive. Their tendency to provide autonomy to AppDynamics while still giving us the warm hug and support of a huge corporate giant has been well... great!","From a cultural perspective I always chafed at tendency for many especially in the corporate office to want o sugar coat everything. When I initially joined it wasn't appropriate to point out that we weren't perfect and that we had many things to improve. With many changes at the top including the hiring of David Wadhwani that seems to have changed and we are much more accepting of our faults. I'm very proud to see AppDynamics mature as an organization and realize that there was never any magical pixie dust making us great, it was and is great people and hard work that got us where we are and where we will go.","5.0

What started off as a strong product is slowly declining. Many competitors have begun to catch up or surpass AppDynamics. The sales organization lacks diversity and received the most perks.

There is no work/life balance... you’ll be expected to work on the weekends (data entry and receive multiple emails with actions on a Sunday as an example) 

Managers manage down and have no idea how to manage up. 

Monkeys (managers) and robots (salespeople).

Product is not easy to sell, it’s hard to implement and very expensive, so if customers don’t have a consistent or huge application issue that impacts their business, they will not buy. This is a luck of the draw type of situation. Your territory may not have orgs with perceived big application issues and you will make no money while being micromanaged. 

Very stressful job

Cisco has taken over comp plans, so much harder to make money and they are over hiring so smaller territories.

The management system at AppDynamics is a joke and plays basically on favoritism. They promote people to managers that have no business managing people and have absolutely no experience. 
If you want to grow in your role, you are roadblocked because god forbid you have more experience or certifications than your manager. They are not interested in letting people take initiatives or come up with ideas and they are constantly shutting down any conversation as a ""miscommunication in role"".
Managers are clueless and like to push their weight around based on their title and nothing else.

After the initial excitement settled down and through the IPO / acquisition changes, I still feel love to go to work . A female engineer, I feel I am very respected by my peers and my manager. Career path is clear to me. People here are always trying to make things fun, from a big holiday party to a bug bash. Even an engineer like me felt like to dress up to attend a grand holiday party held in SF City hall. In a bug bash, you can dress crazy and get a prize. The HRs would never miss any holidays or spirit days to throw a happy hour. There are daily fresh floral arrangements at the front desk and entrances on each floor. We have three-day hackathons, and this year we will have two! I worked on an AI project and an IoT project in past hackathons. None of these were related to my daily duty. How cool was that? The coolest thing is, if your project wins the top votes, besides award dollars you can demonstrate your project in AppSphere, a customer and partner conference usually held in cities like Las Vegas, London or New York, in front of a broad audience of more than two thousands! Besides badminton team, soccer team, cricket team, foosball tournaments, there are events and outings specifically for women organized or sponsored by the company's two women organizations: Women In Technology and Women In Engineering. Many female colleagues get opportunities to attend Grace Hopper Conference, or Google I/O, etc. Our parent company Cisco also has a global Women's Day conference.

While this leads to growing pains it also means there are opportunities for professional growth and financial reward that aren’t available at most other companies. Can be a great stepping stone to other Silicon Valley companies. Product - The product is great and has a tremendous moat. Being able to see every line of code puts the company in a fantastic position with the ability to expand in numerous directions. There are multiple product lines using different tech so there is always something interesting to learn. People - Some really smart people to learn from in multiple areas. A lot of genuinely good and friendly people. The culture takes it’s toll though and few people actually seem happy with the company. Good diversity with different backgrounds and people from all over the world, better than your typical silicon valley company. Some teams are great, some teams should be avoided like the plague. Same for managers. Work life balance and work from home opportunities can be good. As with most places, the team and manager will make the difference.","Culture - Zero transparency. A team gets hacked and it gets hushed up, no lessons learned. People leave and you never know why. Everything happens behind closed doors. Nothing is really data driven, just what senior people want. Communication is horrible, with people often ignoring direct emails. Management - Finger pointing is the norm. Bad mouthing and placing blame on other teams and subordinates is fairly common. Leaders are seldom held accountable for anything as long as they smile and tell the CEO what he wants to hear. Sycophants tend to be promoted with loyalty to your manager more important than loyalty to the company. Some managers won’t hesitate to lie or sabotage things to promote their agenda. Many mangers have no idea how to lead or help subordinates grow their careers. Political Grinder - Work hard, make an impact, have the credit taken by others. Politicians thrive by sweet talking the CEO/CTO and bashing others. Most the best people leave after a year or two (sometimes quicker) when they realize things won’t change and that loyalty to your manager is more important than the results you produce for the company. The endless stream of people who think this will change is a goldmine for the grinder though.","3.0

This company will throw you into the deep end and expect you to sink or swim. You're given the opportunity to actually show your true strengths without bureaucratic red-tape holding you back. There never has been a day where I felt I wasn't being challenged to my fullest potential. - IQ: the collective intelligence and experience of this company is nothing to take lightly. There is a powerhouse of industry experience, knowledge and IQ. - Culture: this company does care about the employees. Just recently HR held a leaderboard of ideas for employees to suggest the benefits they would like to see. Of the top five, 4 of them were adopted and rolled out within a month. Employee benefits are not lip-service for recruiters to attract new prospects; they actually do take care of their work force. - Food: best breakfasts and catered lunches. Bottomless supply of drinks, coffee, snacks and even meals for those days you want to grab a quick lunch at the office for yourself. - Office: you can sit and work, stand and work, walk and work on the tread-desks, or throw your legs up and lounge in any of the ""lounges"" that are placed throughout the office. - Massages: this speaks for itself - Highly competitive salaries, stock options. No 401k matching, but you cannot expect that from a pre-IPO company at this stage.",- Working in downtown SF means paying lots of $$ for rent. Luckily the salary helps with that. - No bonuses.,"5.0

They have filled those requirements and so much more. I was fairly new to the whole concept of APM before I was thrown into it and the excitement hasn't let up since day one. Even with a good run professionally with good teams, good projects, good pay, good people etc. AppDynamics has taken it all to another level. The company is loaded with smart, hard-working people and every piece of the company is dynamic and energetic. The cutlure is really fun and even in my not so long tenure have started to make not just good office relationships but even good friends there. (The external events such as paintball, dinners, happy hour, the zoo, etc don't hurt either.) There is always something to learn, something to investigate, something to do. Its a great ride and I only see it staying that way. Bottom line, this was a good career decision to come to AppDynamics and I am very happy to be there. I am learning a lot and also getting to be involved in many things in addition to my own job which keeps things interesting.","In full honestly, it was a bit overwhelming to start, but with the combination of being a new domain for myself and a slight change from my previous professional life this was probably due to my own lack of knowledge in the domain along with the growing pains of a start-up. Sometimes the battles are long and even with that feeling of driving a problem to a successful conclusion, it can wear on you. This though would apply anywhere and isn't specific to AppDynamics.","5.0

With a decent account list, you will always make money. There are also excellent promotion / pay rise opportunities because there is such a high turnover of staff and management is desperate to positively spin this as a good thing meaning people are frequently promoted way above their capabilities. Good for the individual but some what self fulfilling as others then leave because they have managers with no experience, training or competency.","The biggest issue with AppD is the fact the thought leadership has all but gone. The real engine that drove AppD forward and made it successful has left. Those who have come in after just blindly try to replicate other peoples ideas but lack the authenticity and understanding. There are also major issues behind the scenes with the product development and SaaS which is very poorly managed resulting in numerous issues for customers. There has been a massive loss of developers meaning product release keep slipping back and Cisco has prioritised integration into its portfolio over any genuine innovation. The brain drain also extends to the Sales and Sales Engineering teams. Huge name customers with massive lifetime spend are now being managed by very inexperienced reps who have no idea about the product, the company or how to get anything done. All up, AppD is still a good place to be, but it is not the rocket ship or start up people claim it to be.

Thu Jun 04 2020 02:19:44 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Field Sales Representative,"London, England",Current Employee ,Really proven themselves during difficult times,I have been working at AppDynamics full-time for more than a year,"Honestly, working at AppDynamics has been quite the rollercoaster. It's definitely not the same company it was in its start up phase, with many of the original senior leadership gone. That has its pros and cons. While the ""old AppD"" was hard going, with very poor work/life balance, and a culture to be proud of how far and hard you could push yourself, it was pretty much a baptism of fire. You were learning from the best how to be the best, if you were motivated by that then you come out the other side learning an unbelievable amount and having faster and better development into how to successfully and repeatedly run large enterprise software sales cycles. If you give it your all and persevere, management and leadership always have your back to the core. When things aren't working, they look at the data and find actual ways to improve, not empty suggestions to just ""try harder"". But make no mistakes, it is one of the hardest jobs you'll ever do. I've never known such a flat hierarchy structure where you're encouraged to engage with the global leadership team for your deals from early on in your career. Growth and development is paramount. That being said, I honestly can't say what it would be like for new hires now i feel the culture and training is very dependent on the individual managers continuing to drive the original culture. Finally, during Covid and the current uncertainty, AppD & Cisco have really proven themselves that they care. We're working from home, our safety is paramount. If you need to take time with your families it's encouraged. We had budget allocated to buy anything we needed to get our work from home set up . Business is still going well, but they are responding to what's happening in the world not shutting their eyes to it and pushing a business as usual agenda. The flat hierarchy leaves the communication between execs all the way through to new hires open.","There's definitely uncertainty at the moment in where the business is going with Cisco. I would say if you're still looking for the hard really intense start up culture that AppD used to have then you may have missed the boat. If you're looking for somewhere that still has unparalleled sales training, with more of a corporate culture, and want to learn how to cross sell a platform across an organisation rather than a single tool to specific userbase, then this is the right choice.","4.0

Unfortunately the new wave of “leaders” don’t have any of the credentials to run the dictatorship.,"Despite any previous sales experience expect to be treated like you have just left school. There is an expectation that everybody is incompetent and has to be subservient to the management, opinions are frankly not allowed and during QBRs you are only expected to give “yes” or “no” answers. Calls and meetings will be put into your diary at 7am and considered mandatory without any discussion. The deep dive into your “drive” uncovered during your interview process will be questioned constantly and used to humiliate you publicly. Expect to see marriages breakdown as the norm, as well as health problems - there won’t be any support when this happens. The lion culture has become a cult, and leadership with credibility replaced with a bunch of 30-something’s who thrive on belittling the people around them. It’s a cult.. which if you make it out alive will make you realise the psychological impact of working in such a toxic environment.","1.0

Most lines of business report straight into Cisco meaning you are now bogged down in a ton of process and bureaucracy when you try to get anything done.

The issue however, is that the people who teach it are now poor imitations of those who implemented it. The expense policy is pretty nice, however this is slowly being stamped out due to Cisco getting more involved. If you like to travel, then you get to book good flights and book your own hotels so you can build up reward points.","The UK office has a horrifically toxic culture and feel to it. Within the Sales team the managers are borderline bullies, who seems to actively enjoy breaking people down and making them feel worthless. This may have worked in the past when the managers knew how to pick people up and help them improve, but this is no longer the case. You are lied to during the interview process. Nobody has had a $1m year for a few years, and I think only 1 person has had a $500k year in the last few years. The promise of rapid career progression is also a lie, people get promoted at the same rate as other large software companies now. You're given a list of accounts that have already had at least 2 or 3 people try and break into for several years, and then when you make no progress, you are simply told you need to do longer hours instead of getting actual advice or help. The general attitude is to survive a year and use the name on your CV to springboard into a better role in a different company. When people leave, it's like they never existed and are only spoken about when managers claim they weren't 'AppD material' and were fired for being useless, when this is often not the case.","1.0

As a field sales you’re exposed to a variety of customers from different industries so you learn a lot.","Unless you have no plans of having a life outside work for the foreseeable future, if you’re looking to join the EMEA sales org, beware! The sales “culture” is borderline bullying, unless you’re ok with becoming a micro-managed puppet and yes man. Middle Management is made of top performing individual contributors who are often the most arrogant and devoid of people skills. They are promoted without having a clue about what it means to lead a team of people, hence frustrating their team members while deferring any real decision to senior management. The sales floor is always full of tension and the everyday pressure is akin to what most organizations experience only at year end. There’s no room for disagreement and management thinks they’re always right. Unless you embrace anything they tell you and do what they say exactly how they went it and when they want it, you’re not coachable and therefore have a problem. This includes making up stories (I.e. lying blatantly) to push customers to meet you or to justify your sales tactics. You’re also expected to read and reply emails and even get on calls at any hour or the day, night and over the weekend, and overall use the weekend to think about your deals and plan for the week ahead. You’re discouraged from ever taking holidays and feel guilty when you eventually do (most likely you’ll end up working throughout them anyway). Management holds Cisco in very low regard instead of fostering collaboration with the mother company. They will also try to find ways to take deals or commission away from you if more convenient to them or if they want to teach you a lesson. There’s much more to say but by now you get the picture.","1.0
