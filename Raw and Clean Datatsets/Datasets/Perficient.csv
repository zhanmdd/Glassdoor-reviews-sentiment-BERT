Perficient removed our IT people, so things never really worked right again. They then used the cornavirus as an excuse for more layoffs.

That means there is always something going on and office jobs are stable, even if consultants job aren't.","The company doesn't care about its people. It was the last company I know of that still had people going into the office throughout the coronavirus outbreak, and leadership continued to ignore the situation despite plummeting morale and the fact that they were ignoring advice from the CDC and government and putting the entire St Louis community at risk. The most frustrating part of the company is they insist that Perficient is people driven, but the top leadership of the company is dismissive of the concerns of everyone throughout. Recent changes made by the COO have involved no consultation with others and have meant people are left doing jobs inefficiently and have been taken away from doing more important things, which would be easily avoidable if those in power just listened to the people doing the work. Events regularly get canceled because they're supposedly a waste of time even though they also try to brag about the odd event they don't cancel and insist the culture is important. Maternity leave only became a benefit last year, and it's still only two weeks, which is pathetic and archaic. The leaders still patted themselves on the back about it and ignored that this wasn't enough because they are all old men making big money that don't understand regular people's lives.

The quality of service provided to customers is great, and they have very strong partner relationships. When taken together, you can do really well here and be compensated at a good level for what you accomplish.","In one word: marketing. Perficient is not well know, despite having a presence across North America. This translates to having to spend more time ""getting a seat at the table"" in large enterprises, where you are competing with the likes of Accenture, Deloitte, Presidio, WWT, to name a few. There are parts of the business that seem stuck in early 2000s consulting culture, from the internal systems and operations (heavily reliant on Oracle but just introduced Salesforce), to the cross-practice struggles to get the right people in the room to sell our portfolio.","4.0

Perficient promised a smooth transition since they are ""so experienced at acquiring other companies"" and they also promised no one would be fired as a result of the acquisition. Neither promise was kept, people where fired and onboarding was painful and done with outdated materials by a few years. Benefits overall are worse than when we worked for a small local company and this has impacted people's lives. To this day, Fargo employees that were acquired are kept at a substantially low salary than the rest of the perficient employees, despite management boasting about how much money is coming in. Corporate is more concerned about bringing in money and large projects than about retaining people. At the rate which people are quitting it will be hard to staff the new projects going in. Communication between employees and management is a joke. As a recent example, some big corporate people from perficient came to Fargo for an office-wide meeting that is held every quarter. In the 30 minutes that were reserved for Q&A, one of the big bosses took 25 minutes to talk about himself and his hobby as a DJ and left only 5 minutes for actual questions.

All of the equipment and internal software is outdated and difficult to use, although we are somehow a tech company. They do roll something out with minor improvements every few months with no training, though. Internal processes are weighed down with administrative red tape that makes getting to a decision or next step impossible in the short term. This may be due to those administrators trying to justify their jobs for the next round of expected layoffs. The work is boring. No new exciting clients have come through the door in some time. None of the other business units know what the agency does, so work has dried up, which is why morale is in the dumps. All anyone cares about is utilization and bringing work forward, but no new work is coming in. Everyone is worried about the next round of layoffs. It's hard to imagine this business unit lasting another year. Very few of the directors review work or coach their employees.","1.0

Part of the growth model is based on acquisitions so different business units/ teams can feel like completely different companies with very different policies and management styles. That said here are the pros and cons for my business unit: Flexible work from home policy and good management. Never felt micro-managed and as long as you get your work done and clients are happy, you can do pretty much what you want. Interesting technology and good clients, never had a tense conversation with a client or was staffed on an impossible project. Happy hours, good team work and overall smart people. No drama or politics that I could see.","Not a lot of opportunity for growth, you have to push really hard to move up. and come in with a clear plan. It feels like higher up management only cares about sales revenue, employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction are only important if it can drive revenue up. Somewhat bureaucratic - getting an unusual expense approved is a pain, 2 weeks of vacation needs approval from several managers, the time tracking systems are cumbersome and God help you if you need something from IT.

Working for another business unit is generally painful, different culture and you're often seen as temporary/disposable. -Getting training is difficult and especially if you're billing.

Good peer relationships and sense of teamwork but much of it is just for sense of survival because leaders don't always communicate clear objectives.,"Perficient is a bait and switch opportunity. Despite being in business two decades they are nowhere on the level of real competitors in the tech consultancy arena. I spent several years both in India and in the U.S working with top-tier players. Perficient had approached me twice in recent years before finally presenting a strong window of opportunity that aligned with my own goals. Or so I thought when accepting a final offer. At the end of the day Perficient thinks of itself as a leader and as a solutions provider but it's real inner machinery is a roughly run staffing augmentation operation. Poor planning is common and even when discussion is raised about possible obstacles or impedances the show must go on despite the facts. Management constantly underbids to land projects usually those that other firms were too smart to pick up or often the collateral damage left behind by poor prior engagements. This resulted in stepping into roles and projects that were either over-budget, under-staffed or way over deadlines from our initial involvement. Morale was at times insufferable due to lack of clear direction or any thought toward strategy. Another thing ..the recruiters like to paint the technical roles as remote. Nothing is further from the truth. If you are not just about willing to live from a suitcase you won't make it here even though other companies do the same AND better work with sometimes fully remote teams. For some reason Perficient hasn't figured this out either so be prepared.","1.0

Leadership, take a hard look at what makes the Big 4/8 consulting firms successful - i guarantee you it is not crunched timelines for EVERYTHING, zero value for work/life balance, milking your employees like they are cogs in a machine, terrible maternity/paternity leave policies, crappy health insurance benefits, virtually no training opportunities, I could go on.","1.0

There are never any barriers to progression or even completely changing your career track - if the marketplace / business is there - the opportunity for anyone is there. There are few / if any politics involved. Personalities will always exist and are an exciting part of any company - but career progression and personal success is based on merit. There has been consistent attention to culture and employee environment development through regular employee feedback surveys. I've seen first hand that the survey results are carefully categorized and improvement initiatives kicked off and tracked.,"ulting is not for everyone. It can be more challenging, faster moving and stressful than a corporate IT job. Still - you'll learn a lot more and progress a lot faster in a consulting oriented job. Perficient often does acquisitions and this can create some 'melding' time. Sometimes this can be challenging when you have an entire company of highly entrepreneurial, type A personalities.

They're an average company with average views, and pretty much average everything.","Zero career path. There exists no real future at Perficient. Executive leadership is concerned solely about top-line revenue, what the stock price is doing, and that is all. Despite the rhetoric and propaganda, leadership has zero interest in your career path and what YOU want to do with your professional life. They are solely interested in what you can do for them and they will manipulate you into thinking there really is a light at the end of the tunnel. There isn't. Half of your 401K is tied directly to the Perficient stock and you have no say in that. Take it or leave it. Hint: leave it. Zero organic growth. Perficient only grows by acquisition of other companies. It has horrible attrition and their hiring can barely keep up. Therefore, in order to attempt to stay competitive and give the illusion to the shareholders that Perficient is moving in the right direction, they purchase companies. That forces others to leave as well because they see a new flood of executives higher come into the company which means your career path is now even tougher. The top-line revenue and the stock price hasn't changed in six years. The company is going nowhere.","2.0

Free soda - There are two floors in the St. Louis office. The fifth floor has a better selection, but check both floors if you drink soda. Covered parking garage - You won’t have to worry about cleaning snow off your car. Energizer cafe - the Energizer cafe is a great place to get lunch. I ate there most days. You can use the salad bar or get hot cooked breakfast and lunch. You can also get batteries at very low prices. Workout room - There is a workout room on the basement level. Another perk that I used regularly. It’s clean and brand new (and not used by many people, so not crowded) Freedom on your laptop - You don’t need approval to download programs to your computer. You are free to customize it. IT Department - They are incredibly patient and helpful when you run into issues. I’ve worked with many IT departments that are rude. This team is amazing. The people - You really will have great teammates. Diverse projects - You get to learn about a lot of different businesses and industries. It’s a good place to learn about the major players in technology. COO - Cares about people.","No flexibility - If you work in St. Louis and want to work from home, it’s not allowed. This is a directive from the CEO and won’t change. Leadership - Focus is completely on the sales team and stockholders. They have a conference every year and only sales people are invited. The positive reviews on here are almost exclusively from the sales team. The negative reviews are from everyone else. The tax cut went to a stock buyback program so the CEO and CFO could make more money. None of it went to employees. Layoffs - I’ve had to say goodbye to many great colleagues who were laid off. It’s a frequent occurrence. High turnover - It seems that most people stay here for about 2-3 years and use it as a stepping stone to the next thing. Lack of growth - It’s rare for anyone to get promoted. The job you are hired in is the job you will stay in. Know this going in. Poor communication - Almost everything is heard “through the grapevine.” Tiny workspaces - On the fifth floor, we had small workspaces. You can hear every phone call. The sixth floor is much nicer, but it’s also very corporate there. If you work on the fifth floor, you don’t have access to the sixth. We had to knock on the door until someone answered.

Over time, those that are left that are not in the same league one would expect of a solid consulting firm, and do whatever is possible to keep their jobs. The practice leadership is made up by mostly people with liberal arts degrees that have limited understanding or appreciation of technology and true consulting management.

It’s an ideal place for people who are self-driven, trusted, and want to make a long-term impact. Ideas are welcomed and success is recognized. It’s apparent that Perficient is a magnet for talented and engaged professionals. Before coming to Perficient, I had two appealing offers and it was not an easy decision.

However, any such collaboration is laughably underinvested, non-existent, ignored. One business unit will intentionally put unqualified people on a cross-functional project just so they can recognize the revenue. This is compounded by a good old boys leadership culture where a few key (but ineffective) people attempt to create a business strategy. Where marketing and HR doctor employee survey responses, or just skip them altogether in the years they don't want any feedback. Where billable hours are hidden or falsified by directors.

Tue Mar 07 2017 21:08:31 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Technical Consultant Intern,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,A Modern Day Apprenticeship,I worked at Perficient part-time for more than a year,"The people, the people, the people. When I worked at the Chicago office, the main draw was the incredibly smart, talented and cool people that call it home. That sense of openness and instant comradry was one of the best experiences that I have seen. From a super hip and cool VP to a extremely talented architects to the truly diverse array of trench working developers, everyone brings something to the table. Which inevitably leads to many of them becoming friends, extremely close friends. Whether that is bad or good, depends on your perspective. In addition, the pure undulated talent those people possess would automatically make them coding rockstars in any other company. However, you don't see the primadonna sort of attitude, since everyone is open to helping each other. Being able to bring questions to anyone, was liberating. Makes me wonder how I'll manage after coming from that. Lastly the pay was extremely generous considering since I was only working their part time, though I didn't get bonuses or compensation.","Since Perficient is primarily a consulting company, they are laser focused on billable hours since that’s how they make money. To the degree that when a developer or project manager isn’t on billable hours, they for the most part don’t work. The lack of internal projects that could utilize this talent when projects are far and few between sets in motion, both the waste of resources that could improve the company but also degradation of the skillsets of the developers. In addition, there seemed to be quite a bit of communication blockages and the like, but that might be that I was the last man on the totem pole. I was usually the last person to know about changes that were going to happen. For instance, there was times that my boss was so busy that I didn’t have any feedback or contact from him, for nearly three months. Another instance of this, was when we had a re-organization. In this instance, I was the last to know, which resulted in nearly a day of lost time of trying to find out who my boss was. I also had very little feedback on any of my training or internal projects that I did, that lead me kind of float around, self training myself to whatever I could reasonably expected to do. It certainly it didn’t help matters that I was kept at only working a few days a week. Which leads to my next complaint. While everyone else said, or told me that Perficient was a leading edge in career opportunities and advancement from my point of view this is their weakest area. Everytime I tried to increase my hours, they would dismiss my point about lack of budget. Even though they hired a dozen other developers and project managers when I was their. What I’m not sure about whether this was factional politics at work, with my advocates just being on the losing side or maybe I wasn’t as valued as I was lead to believe. Again pointing to early point here.","4.0

Wed Dec 21 2016 18:24:50 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,, ,Avoid This Place,I worked at Perficient,"I'm trying hard to think of one but can't. There is no vision from management, basically they are trying to drain as much money as they can from any client by winning business and having the most junior (e.g. cheapest) staff work on the business. If I was a client I wouldn't hire them period. When I was there and raised a concern that the people assigned to an account didn't have the experience the clients agreed to the response I received was they ""didn't care, as long as they still paid the bill"". So I guess the pro would be they're making money, unless you're a client then its at your expense. Consider yourself warned. If you are a client ask them to show a detailed summary of who is working on your business, then I would reassess if you want them as your agency.","They're an IT company, not a digital agency as much as they want to be. Basically they bought some digital agencies, dismantled them and try to tout them as their digital agency. However, there's no leadership, no vision and no creative directors, which is particularly concerning for an agency. They had some creative directors, they left and of course they never replaced them but when your goal is to gouge the clients for every last cent why pay for creative talent. If I was a client or employee looking at this place I would look at any other option and pursue it. From an employee perspective, if you do decide to work there and they ""downsize' be prepared because they don't believe in severance. There were people with over five years getting let go in their last transition with no severance at all. If you have any other options aside from working at this place take them. There's no career direction, the upper management is incompetent (if you don't trust this review read the others), and the work environment is the worst I've seen in 20 years in this business. All of their evaluations are done on utilization, so if you're cheap and 100% billable you're fine. But if you are beyond entry level look out. It was so bad when they acquired Enlighten in Ann Arbor that they lost both creative directors, the agency president, most of their engineers and anyone else who could get out within the first 9 months from acquisition. If you have talent and have options avoid this place, you will be glad you did. And if you're a client, check your options, there's a reason they call you ""customers"" and not partners like other agencies. Any other options would be better than using them.","1.0

For the majority of positions you could work from home - even when you had a local office. However, they are doing away with a lot of that. If you land in a good business unit you may work with some really great people, as I did. The business units are all different from each other because they were mainly created by acquiring small companies which are able maintain their pre-Perficient cultures for a period of time. This company structure explains why you see some great reviews and some horrid ones.","As you can read in many of the reviews, an employee is considered valuable if they are billable. So, internal employees (HR, recruiting, etc) are dispensable. The flexibility mentioned above, which was one of the greatest perks, is being taken away and they are laying employees off and then rehiring people in St. Louis (company headquarters). They also like to lay people off for bogus reasons, quite often it's poor company performance, and then within a couple months they rehire for that same position. And after laying someone off they turn around and tell management that it was the employee's poor performance that was the cause for dismissal. Upper management also asks HR employees to talk to consultants and ask them to write good reviews for this website in exchange for a gift card. I believe a large number of these one and two line decent reviews are from one of these PR pushes. Perficient loves to remind their employees of the company's values, ethics and integrity. There's a reason they have to talk about it so much...","1.0

Good software practice like version control, continuous integration, and issue tracking are ignored. Work-life balance is good from Perficient's perspective. If you perform well they are happy to let you take time off or work around your schedule. However, they are also very happy to let the client abuse your time, so if the client wants you to have a nonexistent life outside work that's how it will be.

For those who have come from the IT Services industry and are looking for a fun, fast paced, yet structured and successful company to work for, this is a great choice. Having come from multipl Global 1000 companies, I had to really dive deep into conversations with local, regional, and national leadership to make my decision to come here. Do they have everything figured out, of course not. Do they have hundreds to thousands of smart motivated people to help get them there, absolutely. I encourage you to make your own decisions and ask to speak with senior members of the organization to come to your own conclusions. After almost (6) months on the job I have come away far more pleasantly surprised than shocked by any of my encounters. One of the best parts of being in leadership here at Perficient is that you genuinely have the lattitude to make a huge difference both in a local market and nationally. For any new employees coming in, make sure you know exactly who you work for, what your short, medium and long term career opportunities are, and do not be afraid to ask for meetings 1-2 levels above your hiring manager. Everyone at Perficient is very approachable and eager to welcome new members to the team.",Perficient has grown through acquisition. There is far more good from this formula than bad. Over the past year the organizational structure and go-to-market have changed to better align national delivery but the reality is this is a 2-3 year process. The local GM's need to grow more towards entreprenuers and away from strictly local delivery GM's. This will help with staff decisions being made on a project-by-project basis to long term FTE decisions to improve the mix of our markets and our expertise.

I left a very major prestigious software company where I worked for over a decade to come here and I knew I had made a terrible mistake by my second day. I was hired to ""Build the Practice"" but I had absoutely no such opportunity. I was just another delivery resource in the end. And I was very clear that I did not want to be a delivery consultant. I can't speak for the rest of the company, but the Oracle Tech practice is vapor. This company in my opinion is nothing more than a glorified body shop. They sell themselves as a Soutions ulting Company but they do not hire to the bench, which is to say they do not have any substantive technical resources on the payroll. My direct experience was that they would sell expertise which they do not have in house and in the event that they sold the engagement, they would then try to find the expertise off of the street, basically hiring on demand. Management was incompetent with no Oracle experience whatsoever. I felt I was being compelled to lie everytime I was asked to write a Statement of Work, knowing that we did not have the expertise in house. Many conversations with sales revolved around how we convey to the customer that we actually had experience in some particular technology when in fact we did not. I would get a request from a sales person for a statement of work, (usually I never even got to speak with the customer in order to perform a proper discovery). I would write the SOW, then send the skills requirments to the recruiter. The recruiter would initiate a search to find people with the skills that matched the requirements in the SOW, and then string along the candidates while they tried to sell the solution to the customer. The other laughable aspect is that everyone was an Architect irrespective of experience. I personally worked with someone being billed out as an Oracle SOA Architect when they had absolutely no experiene with Java, SOA Architectures, Jdeveloper, Oracle Middleware, SQL, etc. The minimal Oracle knowledge was aquired while employed there installing a demo system. The culture is creepy. I felt isoslated, there was no sense of teamwork, it felt more like I was working at a car dealership. Everything revolved around making the quarterly numbers. Finally I had enough, and when I gave 2 weeks notice I was informed that day was my last and got jipped out of my final 2 weeks notice pay. So even though I can say I took the high road, this action speaks volumes about the integrity of this company. I was ignored by HR and upper management. No one ever returned any of my emails. They demand 2 weeks notice, but don't expect to get paid for it. Many people just quit. Now I understand why. Final note, Don't beleive the positive reviews here. I made the same mistake and only read the first few. There seems to be a concerted effort by management to post a bunch of positive reviews to push the bad ones back a few pages. Read all of them, I did after the fact, and regreted ever working for this horrible place.","1.0
