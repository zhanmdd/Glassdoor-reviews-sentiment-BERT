However, if you take the job at face value, the benefits, work culture, and snacks are pretty good. I would even go so far as to say that the benefits are actually on par with other tech companies - they offer less PTO, but have a really good medical benefit system that include mental health and wellness benefits. I enjoy the work culture and feel like I'm learning a lot from my experience. It's dependent on what department of User Ops you get into, but I don't regret accepting my job at Yelp.","-pay!! I understand that Yelp has several cities to work across and they standardize the wages, but the SF wages are barely competitive -back to the young people: as with any tech company, management can be a little unorganized. yelp is interesting though because there ARE higher level people who have been at yelp for 5+ years now, but on the lower level you do get the younger, less experienced managers. -if you can't focus on your own grass, you will get annoyed seeing the greener grass from other tech companies lol.

You'll meet some of the best people at this job and those very relationships are what keep you at this company. The sales training I received here is considered some of the best in the industry and I would do it again for the sales experience & training. Amazing parties & happy hours.,"Where should I begin: Just to paint a picture I was with Yelp for 3 years and left prior to the furloughs and layoffs (willingly). Having operated at the very low end of the spectrum in the beginning of my career to someone who was a top producer month after month you have to learn how to play the game. Managers will leverage their relationships with you as a means of generating revenue. Once you're off the team/terminated/willingly quit/put your 2 weeks notice in you might as well be dead to them. The product is antiquated & the short sale is glorified(your account only has to stay advertising for 50~ hours for you to receive commission). Keep in mind the product will not work for 90% of the accounts you sign up, even with proper onboarding. Top producing reps and managers know the perfect verbiage to set poor expectations and get the sale in to make sure that the managers are generating revenue. However managers are not paid on how many of the accounts retain rather % to quota/target and how many reps retain org wide (not accounts). The best managers know how to use sympathy ( your ""why"")to increase performance. Expect a 1 on 1 with your new manager asking you why you work at yelp and who you do it for so they can use this information against you in the future. Yelp preaches that it whole heartedly believes in diversity and inclusion.Yelp YoY also publishes a Yelp blog regarding diversity and yet the numbers reflect a disparity in African American/minority hires into management/leadership or rather the lack thereof since 2014. Something I noticed as well that Yelp will not promote top producing bilingual AE's as a means of keeping them in their chairs to produce revenue. They will however play favorites and put reps who brown nose effectively and may not necessarily have the best sales skills/ social skills & consistently look like (have similar backgrounds & literally look like) the directors and office heads across the org. Those who succeed have a strong drink the kool-aid mentality. The best brown-nosers get the best territories which then in turn yields the best revenue and the best opportunity for a promotion as long as you don't fall into the diversity curve(you'll have a harder time trust me). The culture which can be seen as a pro to some and a con to others. If you like drinking and blacking out often this is the place for you (perfect for college kids as Yelp is known as college 2.0). If you're even a little strange/socially awkward you will not thrive at this company. The Scandals include many managers and directors who were forced to leave due to sleeping with reps to help them with promotions. Sleeping with other people in the office is also frowned upon however the office head is married to the mid market head which makes sense somehow. The best reps coincidentally happen to be on their cell phones often to make calls (to use poor language and lie to business owners), then win the trophy and get shouted out by the office head. The following month most of the accounts don't pay and are left on collections. Some reps are very good at using poor language as well as setting good expectations with other accounts to make sure their account retention doesn't go lower than the 8% which is required to not owe money to Yelp as an AE. Some top producing managers also know that their reps are shady selling and turn the other cheek because this means a bigger check for both parties. During my exit interview all of this was mentioned to the office HR head. She just wrote down notes and after checking in with colleagues months after no changes were ever made.","2.0

Tue Jun 09 2020 13:37:48 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Amazing people / Awful mission statement,I worked at Yelp full-time for more than 3 years,"To start - I don't want this to look like a full onslaught against Yelp Inc. The company itself has clearly made a name for itself across the restaurant community and as such as been able to expand to other areas as a result. The pro's and con's that I mention in this review don't only cover my own personal experiences at Yelp (as a white male) but also those experiences of individuals that did not have as loud a voice as I. SO PROS: THE PEOPLE - not the managers or directors, your actual colleagues, those people that sit directly next to you. Those are the people that care about you and the only ones that ever will. I met people here that will be invited to my wedding but I think that could be said for any work experience so I don't necessarily think this is a positive reflection on Yelp or even their TA team (more on them in cons). 2 MONTH INITIAL TRAINING - there's no other sales company that I know of that provides their new hires with a 2-month long training program. While some of this training is done on the floor and on the phones, if I were to compare this to my other sales experiences, the info and prep you receive is lightyears ahead. (the problem is what happens after training, more in cons). ORGANIZATION/CRM/PARTNERSHIPS- Yelp has a direct partnership with Salesforce and Workday as well as other pretty reputable names across HR/Sales tech so most of your internal work needs are going to be pretty accurately fulfilled and you shouldn't have much of an issue training yourself up. I was glad that the company had invested so much in other areas beyond just training.","DIVERSITY & INCLUSION - Not long after I left the company , I did some research on Yelp's Diversity & Inclusion head. I was shocked that I had literally never heard their name in my 3 years at the company. I had initially starting hearing about D&I employees right when I left college in 2015 so this isn't a new thing but I had never thought about the fact that they were extremely underrepresented as a dept head at the company. Go back a few years now, as I began to lean into the job, get better at it and network with my colleagues, I learned that Yelp, like many other entry-level sales companies, had a diversity problem. In my 3 years at the company, there was only 1 non-white director or executive in NYC and while there was a ton of female-representative which I loved there were 0 people of color in leadership positions. This was something that I had personally expressed as a problem to those I felt that I trusted within the company but I never actually made it a point to bring it up as a real issue. To this day, I could tell you that there still isn't a POC (person of color) in a director of sales position at least in NYC (the melting pot of the United States) office. Not only that but there aren't very many in managerial positions either which just doesn't make sense to me when you have a company that's HQ'd in San Fran and literally has a pulse on the demographics of this country. The company needs to make more of a concerted effort to hire poc's. Even the TA team - super white. HR - over the course of 3 years, I only met one HR rep for the entire NYC office 1k+ people. They didn't have the greatest reputation amongst employees and my experiences with them were basically making appointments to speak with them about very small one-off conversation type of things. In my exit interview, I did not feel as though the grievances and issues I brought up to them actually were heard and I can tell many other people feel this way. There were also rumors and instances of sexual harassment and abuse that would go around the office constantly, none which i knew to be true. I would however, expect that company to directly address rumors like that rather than letting them just subside and the people involved to quit or sue. Managers - I had my best and worst manager of my sales career at Yelp. It's very hit or miss. There is a leadership training program that all managers must go through now but it truly just seems like a meeting that they use to see who will speak up the most and drinks the most kool aid. Most of my negative convos at Yelp surrounded around my ""why"". (why am I working at an entry level job right out of college in NYC.... like is that really a real question). the problem was I wasn't super forthcoming on my why because my why was to get further in my career and make money, I don't need someone to keep reminding me of that at 23 years old living in my first apartment in the city. Most managers DO NOT CARE about you. They only care about THEIR NUMBER. If there is a team of 12 and you each have a quota, they want to hit whatever it would be if you all hit quota. The problem is, this means that 2-4 people on each team get most of the time with their manager and that leads others to failure. And if they don't care about you, why should you care about your clients? The normal sales cycle is usually about 20 mins on the phone and then never speak with them again. Maybe this is why Yelp has such a bad reputation amongst small business owners. Jeremy Stoppelman - It's time to stop whining about Google and actually listen to your clients needs. There were so many interesting ideas and things that I would get on the phone from clients that would never ever be considered. Yelp has spent the better part of the last decade obsessing over how Google has overtaken them. Jeremy's literally came out as saying Google wants them to tank. Maybe if you obsessed more with the people that are spending money with you, you'd be more successful in your mission. Reviews - the whole algorithm is ambiguous and unfair - TELL PEOPLE WHY THEIR REVIEWS ARE BEING REMOVED!","2.0

This was something that I had personally expressed as a problem to those I felt that I trusted within the company but I never actually made it a point to bring it up as a real issue. To this day, I could tell you that there still isn't a POC (person of color) in a director of sales position at least in NYC (the melting pot of the United States) office. Not only that but there aren't very many in managerial positions either which just doesn't make sense to me when you have a company that's HQ'd in San Fran and literally has a pulse on the demographics of this country. The company needs to make more of a concerted effort to hire poc's. Even the TA team - super white. HR - over the course of 3 years, I only met one HR rep for the entire NYC office 1k+ people. They didn't have the greatest reputation amongst employees and my experiences with them were basically making appointments to speak with them about very small one-off conversation type of things. In my exit interview, I did not feel as though the grievances and issues I brought up to them actually were heard and I can tell many other people feel this way. There were also rumors and instances of sexual harassment and abuse that would go around the office constantly, none which i knew to be true. I would however, expect that company to directly address rumors like that rather than letting them just subside and the people involved to quit or sue. Managers - I had my best and worst manager of my sales career at Yelp. It's very hit or miss. There is a leadership training program that all managers must go through now but it truly just seems like a meeting that they use to see who will speak up the most and drinks the most kool aid. Most of my negative convos at Yelp surrounded around my ""why"". (why am I working at an entry level job right out of college in NYC.... like is that really a real question). the problem was I wasn't super forthcoming on my why because my why was to get further in my career and make money, I don't need someone to keep reminding me of that at 23 years old living in my first apartment in the city. Most managers DO NOT CARE about you. They only care about THEIR NUMBER. If there is a team of 12 and you each have a quota, they want to hit whatever it would be if you all hit quota. The problem is, this means that 2-4 people on each team get most of the time with their manager and that leads others to failure. And if they don't care about you, why should you care about your clients? The normal sales cycle is usually about 20 mins on the phone and then never speak with them again. Maybe this is why Yelp has such a bad reputation amongst small business owners. Jeremy Stoppelman - It's time to stop whining about Google and actually listen to your clients needs. There were so many interesting ideas and things that I would get on the phone from clients that would never ever be considered. Yelp has spent the better part of the last decade obsessing over how Google has overtaken them. Jeremy's literally came out as saying Google wants them to tank. Maybe if you obsessed more with the people that are spending money with you, you'd be more successful in your mission. Reviews - the whole algorithm is ambiguous and unfair - TELL PEOPLE WHY THEIR REVIEWS ARE BEING REMOVED!","2.0

I very rarely felt like the company cared about me or any of its employees. While kegs and games are fun, what is way more important to employees is some degree of autonomy and respect from their managers. The rules were rigid, employees were treated like children, and everyone faced incredible stress. I was a high performer who was promoted multiple times and played by all the Yelp rules. Nonetheless, I was consistently very stressed & not supported. Finally, the lack of diversity amongst senior leadership of the office is deeply troubling. Yelp is a company that touts diversity, but in reality, is all talk. I know Yelp very well from many years there, and would never recommend it.","1.0

Mon Jun 08 2020 20:28:06 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,The role has potential. Just know what you're getting into,I have been working at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"Industry-leading sales experience- They have been selling the product for so long that they have perfected the sales process (It would be nice if they did this with the product too). You'll become a very good salesperson if you put your head down and put effort into getting better. Career growth opportunities (not as much of a pro as it used to be)- Used to have many avenues to grow your career (i.e. Management, Restaurants, Enterprise) but they have slowly stopped hiring for various teams (i.e. Franchise) and it's hard to say what the future holds after the massive company changes from Covid-19 Personal Growth- This could vary from person to person because this job is truly what you make of it. You can choose to be that bad employee that sits around all day avoiding work and playing on your phone (which quite frankly is a waste of time considering time is money in sales and you can probably be getting paid more to be a front-desk attendant to do the same thing), or you can actually try and grow as a salesperson and professional. There's nothing more gratifying than having a breakout month or even a good week because you focused on your work and achieved your goals. I've had some great moments like this that I hope I never forget. Great people- The other reviews aren't lying when they say you will meet great people here. They actually hire you based on your ability to connect with people since you don't need prior experience. It's most likely the reason you'll want to stick it out and stay with the company (pro-tip: this alone is not a good reason to stay at any company. You can leave the company and still remain friends/keep in touch). Great office- Absolutely stunning office in NYC right on Madison that spans the whole city block (not very common). They have 3 floors in that building and a new floor in the building across the park above Eataly. There's plenty of space and great amenities such as a Barista that serves whatever type of coffee you want for free. Kitchen stocked with fruit, bagels, and snacks to take advantage of. Beer on tap for after hours... yea it's a cool office Great benefits- solid Health, Dental, Vision. 401k matching actually got better this past year. Health used to be completely free until they started charging 50/month for it but it's still totally worth it.","*insert obligatory ""Where to begin?"" I'll preface this by saying a lot of these negative reviews are from people (most likely kids fresh out of school) who have very unrealistic expectations about what a sales job entails. ""Having a monthly quota/target"" is not a con with working for Yelp as every sales role has monthly expectations such as these. The same goes for having to cold-call businesses. These are things that were made clear by the recruiters during the interview process and you should not take the job unless you're prepared to deal with such things. Commission/compensation: This is the primary reason why I don't see a long-term career with the company. All positions from AEs to the director level are severely underpaid compared to the competition. Average to low-performing reps are not making good money and even the top reps that are making good money could be making double at another company. Something to consider when the cost of living in NYC is what it is. Management- This is such a gamble as your manager will have a very big impact on whether or not you succeed in the role and even get promoted. The training managers are reps that performed well (most of which did so by using misleading language) who are not actually trained on how to manage human beings. Your job as a manager is to use your reps to close deals- that's it. Once you're off their team they will pretend like you don't exist (some are really cool and won't do that but the serious ones that are top managers will do this). A lot of them (not all) will use emotions to manipulate you to work harder/ produce more revenue. I had one manager bring us into a room right before lunch and break down sobbing crying because we didn't reach our goal for the morning.. let that sink in. This is already a stressful job and doing things like this only compound that. The second problem with management is that they don't care about your growth. After a certain point, they stop caring about helping you improve as a rep. They also won't care about helping you get promoted if they already have someone on the team that has a higher potential of getting promoted (most likely from favoritism). Now keep in mind not every manager is like this, but about 95% are. There are great managers who do a great job of promoting and managing reps but they are few and far between. You can try to request to be on their team but the chances of that actually happening are akin to winning the lottery. Culture- As others have stated. This place can have a very fratty culture at times. It can change based on which neighborhood you're in but generally there's a large majority of people that are only interested in getting drunk after work and sleeping around. The gossip is insane and if you start seeing or dating someone it quickly becomes public knowledge. It's not uncommon to hear about managers/directors sleeping with reps and in some cases, it's not even a secret! I've met a lot of exceptionally bright people while working here but a lot of them really need to start acting their age.","3.0

Despite what you hear or have heard about working here as an AE, given the stage of life I was in, I was fortunate enough to receive the best opportunity I could have ever asked for. The leadership I received was special. The managers, directors, and head of office genuinely cared about my development as a person in and out of the office. The culture is strong and unique. The friendships I developed and grown over my time at Yelp will be friends for life. At the same time this is a role you get what you put into. I know this sounds cliche, but truthfully, if you are consistently transparent with leadership about your growth as a sales professional, you will see yourself grow. Looking back at that first day in 55, I would have never imagined I would be where I am today. There will always be times when you hit a low in your sales month or just in life, but if you let them, the people here will always be there to pick you back up and teach you how to pull yourself up. I am appreciative for my time at Yelp and thankful to all those who took the time to truly invest in me as a person.","Of course with every company there are cons. Yes, the base salary is low for San Francisco especially first starting out. With that being said, by hitting your number and more, the commission can be great. Additionally, I am one of those weird people who is happy with an average pay as long as I enjoy the those around me. Fortunately, I did leave Yelp before the COVID 19 layoffs hit. However, my star rating went from 5 stars to 4 stars after hearing about this experience so many of my former co workers faced. A job truly becomes a challenge every single day when you can't trust who's in management.Thankfully, I was in a position where I trusted everyone in leadership. However, I don't blame those who are skeptical of working at Yelp given how leadership handled layoffs, furloughs, and so forth. I encourage to whoever is reading this, truly do your research and use your best judgment when looking into a position at this company. I hope Yelp can recover from all this and leadership can learn from their mistakes. Given my overall experience, I do believe this is something higher ups wish they had handled differently as time has gone on. We are all human, mistakes are made. Always remember, people aren't one thing.","4.0

It can makes ""outsiders"" feel they have to inauthentically assimilate to their culture. The overwhelming ""promote from within"" attitude leads to more of this, especially given so many managers are figuring it out for the first time rather than bringing valuable diverse industry experience. While Yelp values work life balance, certain organizations' cultures also have a lack of focus on having good operational process, and lack of rigor and seriousness for for building things with quality engineering. It can end up seeming more a place to go and have fun with other adult engineers (overheard derisively as ""an adult daycare"") versus a place to go and build great things and grow in your career.","3.0

Some of my best friends have come from me working at Yelp! They do a great job hiring people of so many different backgrounds - Managers that I've worked with were great at communication. I've never felt like I couldn't tell my managers anything that was on my mind. - Opportunity to continuously learn since the mantra of ""the only constant is change"". I can easily say to other employers that I know how to successfully sell regardless of any product changes. - Liberal PTO policy. If you had PTO, you have every right to use it (and your manager shouldn't make you feel bad for using it). - No one talks about it, but the benefits are SO good. Probably because college grads don't think that health care coverage is super important (especially if they're on their parents' til 26).","- Over-glorified some sales reps because they were the top in booked revenue in a given month. No one talks about how many cancellations or chargebacks those reps got and it diminished the quality of the deals that some reps with integrity sold. - Promoted reps to managers poorly. I'm sorry, but promoting a 22 year old who sold record breaking sales in 6 consecutive months (which was also their tenure) is NOT a trait that proves success in a manager role. - You do have to sell a little bit of your soul to be successful in the sales role. There will be times that you hear a genuine ""no"" that disqualifies a business owner from buying ads, but some managers will disregard that and puppeteer you to say some aggressive things. - Upper upper management teaches lower management to put out the fires so they don't have to deal with it.

I don’t even know where to start. Some might think I’m bitter because I got laid off due to COVID. However, I’m honestly blessed because this was 100000% a blessing in disguise. This place is shady, run! You’ll be trained for about two months & I won’t lie, the training is pretty in depth but nothing in the world prepares you for cold calling leads that have been called time and time again. All of your leads are burnt out, you’ll most likely only close new businesses. On the rare occasion that you close a previous advertiser, you’re burning their money, yelp advertising sucks. The cost per click is horrible and I felt terrible selling it. They tell you it’s because it “works”... yeah right. The culture is pretty gross. They’ll tell you if you work hard you’ll be a manager but it’s all a favorites game. Bonus points if you sleep with a manager or people in the “cool crowd” — that’s right, there’s a cool crowd LOL. If you’re a skinny cute girl, even more bonus points for you! People here are OBSESSED and brain washed with spending time together. They live together, work together, sleep with each other, vacation together, spend every waking second together. It’s borderline a cult. You’ll hear people joke about drinking the koolaid. They sell you this corny positive story that anxiety is all in your head & not real. If you get a job offer, run. They’ll tell you that you have so much money to make (which can be true) but there’s so many rules making it almost impossible to make commission you can actually keep. If an advertiser turns off their ads , you’ll get money taken off your commission check or worse, owe Yelp money. These guys are crooks! I could go on, but my fingers hurt from typing into the keyboard so aggressively because MAN does this place truly suck... take it from me, run.","1.0

Will Miss My Friends,I have been working at Yelp full-time for more than a year,You will meet a lot of interesting people. It's good experience for entry level sales. Get promoted fast. Sometimes too fast as people who have been there for less than a year get management. Hourly so you never have to work longer hours if not needed I met my bestest friends while working here and I will probably be friends with them till the day I die.,"I worked at Yelp for a year and didn't mind the job itself. But the main issue with Yelp is management. Managers have no form of leadership training, just reps who are able to close are now just refreshing Salesforce all day to micro manage your metrics. If managers were picked on Leadership, it would be a different story. But they aren't. So you will more than likely get a manager who has no experience managing a team, and who doesn't have the slight idea on how to handle situations. They are just hired to refresh your metrics all day and that's it. If you want real sales training, you will have to teach yourself. I was most successful at Yelp when I stopped depending on my manager for guidance. And that's sad. You will be micromanaged every day. By your manager, and by your director. Expect to be underappreciated everyday, and to overproduce everyday. And the office is very cut throat. I was lucky enough to know how to use the Salesforce and found every report I needed to understand what was happening day to day. I was always able to see what management was doing in order to bump up numbers for their favorite reps. Whether it be switching out their regions every week, or sending all of your accounts out to top reps, or filtering your region so that you get no new leads. I've seen managers go into reps accounts that have closed on their own, and remove the account owner from getting any credit to then place a favorite rep on their team to get full compensation. And this job is all region. Region pools are not made equally. They can control which pool new leads go into. If you notice you're not getting any, management probably wants you out. For culture, you will meet a lot of people you like. You will hate a lot of people as well. You will be compared to every top rep and it gets old very fast. Once you learn to shut it out, you'll be more successful. And if you think selling with integrity will get you far, it won't. You'll notice a lot of customer reviews about the product you're selling on how they were overcharged, charged in general, or it didn't work. It's because reps and managers close deals with very misleading language that still fall into legal terms. So yes, representatives are usually scamming small business owners in order to get a deal on the board. If you look through Salesforce on all of the top reps accounts, you'll notice a lot of refund approvals, transcripts of what the rep said, and shady sales tactics. If you're on a performance plan, your manager is most likely trying to get rid of you. Time and time again I would see reps who were on performance plans get all of their accounts passed out to the team, or the manager will just call and close it for you. But since only revenue booked by you counts to save your job, those deals will not help you. And I just kept noticing over and over that managers and directors were purposely moving accounts out of reps who were struggling to other reps. I doubt Yelp will ever be the same after massive layoffs. They will probably never rehire to the same amount of reps in the future. And it will have a hard time recovering from this. No executives took a pay cut, nor were management hit as hard as the rest of the employees. Just shows how much management only cares about themselves and not the betterment of the staff. They let go of 2100 young adults to save their own interest. Sad part is I wasn't shocked. I expected it to happen a lot sooner. Yelp was worth 4 billion when I joined, and has dropped to 1.2 billion in one year. If you're looking for a quick job, apply when the pandemic is over. Looking for a serious sales role, look elsewhere.","2.0

Wed Aug 28 2019 08:23:09 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Kelly Clarkson - ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)",I worked at Yelp full-time for less than a year,"I apologize if my review is lengthy. I wanted to give as much detail about my experience as possible. Hopefully, my review helps someone. My review is only focused on what I experienced during my time with Yelp, things may have changed since. I was employed by Yelp in the Chicago office from the summer of 2018 to February 2019. I can confidently say it was one of the worst times of my life. My experiences at Yelp mirror a lot of what has already been noted by former and current employees. I, like so many, was grateful to get the call that I had gotten an offer. The thought of working for such a large, well-known tech company was exciting. However, there's a clear distinction, YOU don't work in tech, you work in sales. Welcome to your career. I did not study business or any related major that would lead me to a career in sales. I think most people who end up in sales don't grow up thinking, ""I can't wait to cold-call people when I'm older."" I had worked in another sales role at another company for about a month where the daily metrics/key performance indicators (KPIs) were 200+ cold-calls, 100+ emails, etc. So, learning that Yelp ""only"" required about 70 to 80 calls a day and 25 emails was a dream. THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU (But more on that later)! In the Chicago office, the BASE is $39,000 (before taxes). Why not $40,000? No one knows. To me, a single twenty-something with no kids, this was enough to afford my modest lifestyle. You will have access to a wellness benefit that can cover your gym membership. Use it. You also receive benefits from day one, which is cool, but not super rare for tech companies and startups. ""Plus"" there's the possibility of earning commission (But more on that later).","They typically start people on the second week of the month. So that summer, I along with over 90 other people started our career with Yelp. By the time I left the company, a third of my summer group remained. I didn't necessarily see the high number of new hires as a red flag. I figured maybe they wanted to just knock out training for such a large group at once. I came to realize there is such a high turnover with resignations and firings that it's necessary to hire in such high volume. Training is classroom style for two months. The first two months of employment are the most decent. The first week is solely classroom learning and by week two, you're on the phones and ""ready"" to go! What they don't tell you in the interview (I asked to be sure, given my prior experience at that other company) is about recycled leads. A recycled lead is a lead that has been contacted by prior reps. In some cases, leads have been getting called since 2013. You can imagine they are super excited to hear from Yelp, AGAIN! I understand that in sales, you will have recycled leads, that's a part of the industry. Maybe the prior salesperson didn't sell the product right and this is YOUR chance to say something different to change their mind. Sure, but no, not at Yelp. There is a script (not unlike most sales roles). That's pretty much all the sales language you get. If you come into the role with some experience, you will have a much better time on the phone. If you're pretty much new to sales, good luck. Yelp uses the same exact script for every single business. Calling a contractor? Nail salon? Psychic? Use the script. If you ask your manager (more on that) for valuable feedback or insight on how to approach a certain lead you are not going to get it. Yelp places new hires on teams of about ten. These teams are given a manager who is also in training. YOUR MANAGER IS BEING TRAINED ON HOW TO BE A MANAGER WHILE YOU ARE BEING TRAINED ON HOW TO BE A SALESPERSON. While the job itself is awful, this can truly make or break your experience. If your manager has had previous managing experience, they may actually be able to assist you on your calls. That's often not the case. Most managers are extremely young, which can be a good thing. These are the people that came straight out of undergrad to Yelp, worked as a rep for 1 1/2 to 2 years and then became a manager trainee. Also, it should be noted there is no real trajectory in this role. You work as a Sales Rep for about a year and if you do well you may become a rep for the Mid-Market or National team. Which just means a different volume of cold-calling. Or you could work a year and become a manager in training to manage other people who cold-call. If you survive all of that for years, you may get to be a director. Tough luck if you're a minority though (at least in the Chicago office). Diversity is kind of a problem and an eyesore. There is a ""Wall of Fame"" where reps who have closed/sold a certain number get their photo (poorly) photoshopped to a European monarch portrait. This is problematic in itself but the only person of color, a Black man, has the smallest photo on this wall. His face is photoshopped onto the iconic ""Napoleon Crossing the Alps"" and you can barely make out his tiny face in the painting. There are no directors of color and there are few managers of color as well. The overall aesthetic of the office is young, white recent graduates. The environment is very much like a fraternity/sorority house. It can be very cliquey but you will most likely make friends. The people that work alongside you are generally nice, management and leadership are the people to watch out for. You will bond with your friends over how terrible the job is. However, if you leave and they are still employed with Yelp, you will likely not remain friends. Being friends with someone still employed at Yelp is like looking at your friend claim to be “happy” in an abusive relationship. The environment is one of the worst parts of this role. If you have ever experienced any forms of anxiety or depression, you will definitely be triggered. If you are a recovering alcoholic, your sobriety will be challenged. This office has beer kegs (very much like other tech companies). There are ""off-site"" events that your manager can plan, which basically means go to a bar and drink. You're basically shamed if you don't want to go to these events. On my particular director group, there was an incentive called ""Lunch Club."" The first six reps to get to 25k in a month get to have Rosé with the director. This office encourages alcoholism as a coping mechanism for the high stress of the job. They blast music loudly, which doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Please be prepared to hear the same songs every day, sometimes more than one time in a day. I heard Clean Bandit & Zara Larsson's ""Symphony"" three times in one day. It's a mediocre song at best, imagine being stressed and getting yelled at by business owners, and having to hear ""SYMPHONNNNYYYYYYYYYY,"" multiple times a day. They also played Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)"" daily, how fitting. I'm afraid you're wrong Ms. Clarkson, what doesn't kill you just slowly eats away at you. Reps are given a territory (some have geographic regions) which basically has two areas or cities. In my time there, I went from Winnipeg, Manitoba (Canada) & rural Kansas, to Mt. Rushmore, South Dakota & rural Nebraska, to Garland, Texas & Suburban Chicago. These changes happened in six months. You can imagine how frustrating it is to constantly change territories, especially to go from a decent metropolitan area to a tourist attraction that has closed for the season. All reps are treated equal in regards to their assigned territory. It doesn't matter if you have New York City or San Francisco or rural Alabama. You are expected to meet the same KPIs and quota as everyone. Work starts at 8:30 am sharp. If you have a territory in a different time zone as you, oh well. You're still expected to start dialing, even if businesses are closed. I have never been so micro-managed in my life. You're expected to make 80 dials in a day, get 2 pitches (a pitch is when you run through the entire script with a business owner and show them pricing), and close one deal. If you get to lunch time with no pitches, expect your manager to sit down and look at every SINGLE dial you made. Yelp uses Salesforce which gives them multiple reports which allow them to track everything you do, which of course is necessary but it is overused. My manager would sit and say, ""You called this restaurant at 10:00 am on Monday, and you called at 11:00 today, did you leave a voicemail? Are you sending an email with every call?"" If you get a voicemail when you call a business, you are expected to leave a message and send an email. Imagine calling someone about 6 to 7 times in two weeks (the sales cycle) and leaving the same message and sending poorly constructed email templates. It's harassment. We are encouraged not to use the Do Not Call (DNC) feature in Salesforce. Even if a business owner says, “Please stop calling me! I am NOT interested,” because they didn’t explicitly say “please add me to you Do Not Call list,” you must continue to call and email them. The product doesn't work. Maybe it did a few years ago but the advertising landscape has changed. There are much cheaper and efficient options out there, e.g. Instagram Ads, Facebook Boost Post/Ads, Google Ads. So, trying to tell a hip young nail artist that her Instagram page with 20,000 followers is not as good as a Yelp page is pointless. I have had customers call and complain to me about the product not working. Luckily, I'm a decent human-being, I didn’t over promise like some of the more successful reps do. This role will really mess with your integrity. If you're calling into a rural area, you will feel like crap for forcing a platform on someone who doesn't need it, just to get a sale. Thankfully, there are no contracts, so people can cancel anytime. This will affect your commission should you ever get over that threshold. Reps are only eligible for commission after closing 30k. After that, each month they must reach at least 12k in order to start earning commission. So, you have to close 42k for Yelp before you receive your first commission check of about $120. Commission is paid out separately from your normal salary and also taxed. Most people don’t make it long enough to see commission. Those who do well will note that their commission checks will be affected as their customers cancel their plans. Yelp billed out commission for six months. The highest you could close a business on was a deal worth $540 a month. Yelp assumed they would advertise for six months. $540 X 6 = $3,240 or 3.24k. You would have to close about thirteen “full-comp” deals before you get your first commission check. Of course, there were cheaper plans that would allow for smaller amounts. But reps are really encouraged to push business owners towards spending fifteen dollars a day (or more) so they can get the full-sized deal. Most people stop advertising after realizing the product doesn’t work. It’s cost-per-click (CPC) and does not guarantee any customers. If a contractor has a $23.00 CPC and someone is shopping around for a contractor getting multiple quotes and viewing multiple businesses (like most people do when shopping around). Yelp will charge that business for each click even if it did not result in a job. Because they paid for the “exposure.” When and if you are closing a deal, you have to tell business owners that you will stay in touch with them if they have any questions about their advertising “campaign.” However, my manager encouraged my teammates and I to not answer the phone for customers or to simply give them the inbound support number. This was common practice throughout the office. Once, I sat on a phone with a business owner for thirty minutes and listened to their complaints, they were charge over four-hundred dollars and didn’t get a single client. What are you supposed to say to a small business owner? I simply said, “I’m sorry.” I felt awful and dirty. There is an in-house barista but every drink they have is acidic tasting and quite frankly, they’re rude (I suppose it’s because they are only paid minimum wage). Reps are encouraged to consume copious amounts of espresso to “keep the energy up.” There is also free food in the two kitchens. However, it’s mostly prepackaged food full of preservatives and nitrates. Good luck grabbing a Walmart Ready-Pac salad or frozen hamburger because all employees take their lunch at 12:00 pm. The office has between 650 - 800 people, give or take firings/hiring/resignations. The two kitchens are like war zones. You spend your hour lunch break waiting twenty minutes to use one of the six microwaves. But while you’re waiting for your first check or you’re in-between checks, the food is helpful. Just make sure in between enjoying free coffee, food, and soft-drinks, you don’t use the bathroom too often. Your manager will constantly want to know where you are. There is the option to do overtime, it's not mandatory, but boy if it’s the last day of the month (LDOM) and you’re leaving at 5:30, expect a dirty look. I witnessed the top performer on my team and one of the top performers in my entire group break down in tears. Management took this happy and bright twenty-two-year-old girl and broke her. What can I, a twenty-seven-year-old who has multiple jobs, say to a young girl in her first role? Recent grads are the target demographic for hiring because they are the most vulnerable. They don’t know that a work environment isn’t supposed to be (this) toxic. Another peer on my team had a nervous breakdown (on his birthday), he was also fired a week later (not a lie or embellishment). In fact, in a week’s time, my former team lost five people, three were fired and two quit (another rep and myself). Work isn’t supposed to be “easy” but it shouldn’t be this hard. My manager and director would simply tell reps who were unhappy that they are not trying hard enough. In fact, my director sent out an email with an article about the health benefits of stress. This is an individual who would have group meetings with all the teams under his leadership just to yell at them. He would constantly walk around the floor and scream at people if they looked unhappy. You will be forced to stand up for “power-hours” and no, Yelp does not provide standing desks. In addition to possibly earning commission, you can earn other perks such as McDonalds breakfast sandwiches, Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts coffee, an off-site with your team to go drink, taking a picture with a musty jersey, or “bragging” rights. So basically, nothing. You will gain or lose weight, depending on how your body handles stress. You will constantly get sick; the stress will make it hard for your immune system. You will age, a year in this role and you will look older and more tired. You will lose motivation to do anything, even on weekends. It will be hard to imagine life before Yelp. Leaving the company has given me such clarity. While applying for other roles, I was given a writing assignment that took me way longer than it should have. I realized that in the months I’d been employed at Yelp, I hadn’t really used my brain for critical thinking. So, after all this you’re still interested in working at Yelp. Best of luck, welcome to your career.","2.0

Some decent benefits/ pay not the greatest but not the best either. Gym reimbursement.,"Ok so I along with 2100 people were recently laid off due to the Covid-19 mess. It was coming most of yelps most searched businesses were the hardest hit and revenues are plunging. However I was there for a year exactly. I was excited to be joining a big brand name like Yelp and I thought I’d be mostly consulting on Yelp ads to business owners looking to increase their ad performance. That’s not the case as a customer success manager you’re basically in a run of the mill call center and all day long you deal with mostly angry clients. You’d be surprised how many business owners hate Yelp and view it as a bully. So here is the gist of it Yelp is basically a sales company they have a large sales department across six offices and each rep has to make 80 to 100 dials a day they hound business owners till they eventually get someone to sign up for advertising on Yelp. The problem is that the sales pitch isn’t always transparent, and why would it be? the product isn’t that great to say the least, sales people sell dreams that are no where close to reality and the worst part is they don’t explain billing properly their whole aim is to get a credit card on file get them to start ads and then ghost the client. This isn’t some issue of a few rouge sales people this is actually a problem at the top of the management and these practices are encouraged to dupe business owners to sign up quickly so they can nickel and dime them for whatever they can squeeze out of the person. This is where CSM comes in now you’re dealing with a angry person especially first few days of the month when the bill drops who is asking for a refund because they were misled on the sales call and now it’s your job to not only tell them in most cases there is no refund especially if they have cancelled their ads but also try and resell Yelp. The problem is yelp ads don’t really work for most industries lawyers, most doctors, real estate, pet groomers, construction etc I seldom saw any of these business be successful. A lot of it purely depends on the area the business is in and general demand but Yelp sales will try to sell everyone and their mother ads like it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread. The main package is cost per click and then they have some paid products at fixed prices for the month. I would see clients pay for example $570 a month for a couple of months and have no business so who were all these people clicking god only knows honestly though I did hear people complain a lot about spam messages and calls. Anyways that’s a majority of what you as a customer service rep have to deal with and the management just tells you Yelp works these people have no business because people chose their competitors and they need to spend more or improve their page which was completely untrue they didn’t get any business because these clicks are shady as hell and nobody really looks for anything beyond restaurants and nightlife on Yelp and funny thing most restaurants and bars don’t even need to advertise on yelp they do just fine with a free page. Then there is the matter of filtered reviews and bad reviews whenever a business owner received a bad review it was obviously fake (sarcasm) lol and they wanted it removed and Yelp doesn’t remove many reviews so you’re stuck there on the phone being like I get it but sorry people are entitled to their opinion and no one likes hearing that also yelp filters reviews and that angers business owners because now most of their good reviews aren’t showing and you have to be like sorry it’s a software can’t do anything. In the end I have a lot of issues with how this place does business and I can go on but I wouldn’t recommend this place because your anxiety and depression will get triggered mine did. I do want to add I was a top performer I had 90% + rev retention for most of the months and had a great CSAT score good productivity I did my job well because I am a professional but couldn’t stand behind the product and never really had a taste for koolaid. You will meet some good people here and the positive is that the job is so unnecessarily hard that anything afterwards will be easy. You will also meet a lot of koolaid drinking fake smile type people as well who I couldn’t stand. Management is young and their job is to just monitor KPIs they’re not leaders just supervisors who are there to resell yelp to you if they feel you aren’t sipping the kool aid. The culture is ok I mean the job is so taxing, stressful and repetitive that they can’t really do much to make it fun no matter what they do. In the end Yelp put me out of my misery and I am glad for that. Please there are better call Centers out there if that’s your thing skip this one. Hope this helps someone whenever Yelp starts hiring again.","2.0

Every single call expect to get talked to about, even if they went well. The product is only going to work for businesses that already get business from Yelp, or people with more than 15 5 star reviews but most of the people it'll work for won't be willing to talk to you, so prepare to have managers breathing down your neck to scam smaller businesses that you KNOW it won't work for. There's a really high turnover rate, partially people who aren't cut for the job, partially people who can't handle the management style. You have random pointless meetings ALL the time, and it's not uncommon for a manager to pull you aside and tell you you're not trying. Management will send out floor wide emails detailing who is behind and who is ahead (it's always the same star players and if you listen to their calls you'll learn quickly the only way to get ahead here is to do some shifty stuff). PTO and sick days are generous but you're shamed into not using them. There is constant talk about the difference between not feeling well and being sick. But expect to get sick often here because it's a ton of people and you have to high five everyone when they close a deal. Overall the expectations are a bit unrealistic if you still want to abide by a moral code.

It’s been over a month since I left and am with a new company, but looking back my experience at Yelp was truly the worst 11 months of my life. YOUR MANAGER MATTERS- mine happened to be an ex alcoholic, with extremely unstable moods, who was demeaning, demoralizing, loud, obnoxious,unsupportive, condescending and the most belittling person I ever met in my life . yay. Yelp made me realize everything I do not want to seek out in a company for my next role. They make you feel as if you’re just a number - because frankly you are. You are cattle doing the same thing day in and day out . If you’re an independent person who values autonomy this isn’t the company for you - run . The amount of micromanaging that went on triggered my anxiety to the point of panic attacks at my desk. My manager who had a whole slew of issues of her own (truly one of the most unpleasant people I ever met) made me feel like I was a child for having any emotion at all- while she screamed at us and went off on the deep end if we weren’t “green” for the day .( Hitting the daily number for the team ) looking back I’m unsure how I lasted just shy of a year but my manager was a nightmare and if it weren’t for her I MAYBE would have enjoyed my stay (yes like prison ) but I doubt it. The culture is so immature , the managers are so cliquey and childish . Just go anywhere else . Thinking about it makes me sick that’s how bad it was. my new job is SO impressed with my work ethic but I joke it’s the PTSD from the fear of getting up to use the bathroom at yelp . The job truly is a factory setting . You think I’m being sarcastic, I’m really not . Someone else referred to it as a puppy mill and I couldn’t agree more . Please if you’re looking, consider anywhere else but here . The 5 star reviews are so fake - please read the other reviews saying that . Yelp employees writing those reviews - please tone it down if you want to be believable lol cmon now . You sound ridiculous. It’s pathetic.","2.0

Everyone bonds over their individual suffering and it makes the days more bearable. Furthermore, they also offer free coffee, snacks, a fully stocked kitchen, and the employee benefits are pretty good as well.","If you're someone who is anxious, an addict, or has an obsessive personality; this may not be the place for you. The job is VERY mentally taxing, we're essentially being paid to harass people. When business owners do decide to listen and sign up for the ad program its a great accomplishment but the issue is getting them to listen to you that long. -Your manager can make or break your experience. -Panic attacks are a daily occurrence. -Base salary is low. -Lots of microaggressions. -HR is quick to fire you.","2.0

You call small businesses that cannot afford your product. Or they have used your product and they catch on that the ads and other products do not actually work. You make them false promises that their business is going to get flooded with new customers. And they get angry at you because their positive reviews go away when they do not buy or re-up their ads. You are left feeling icky at the end of the day for being a bully to a small business owner that could just as well be your friend or aunt. The upper management uses happy hours and alcohol to make you feel like you are part of the team. But you can tell it is an act and that you are a cog in the machine. The turnover is ridiculously high because people catch on quick that it is a meat grinder. Some will stay since they are promised big bucks that they will not see (like working for herbalife or another MLM where they fill you with false hopes of money). Or some stay because management try to spin it that they are justified in their awful, dark, and sinister approach to making money.","1.0

To say they’re are better options out there is an understatement.,"Everything done at Yelp is to save face, including the responses from Yelp on Glassdoor. They’re scripted and made so they fulfill a legal obligation. I know for a fact that managers will pressure sales reps to drink. Managers having intimate relationships with sales reps and then outwardly favor this person. It’s worse than people think. It’s so real it’s costing the company actual $. The company is a loser. They make new reps do Glassdoor reviews during the high of training . Another move to save face. Ironically a company that is built on not fabricating reviews literally solicits reviews from its naive employees. Bribery from Management to sales reps is a constant.

It’s what will keep you coming in every day. The training is outstanding and I don’t think I am the same person I was when I started. If you can coke call 80+ businesses a day, you can do anything. After 2 months you “roll out” and most managers are extremely helpful, even after training. If you ready your quota consistently every month and live the “yelp values” you can easily move up—to management. Taking a manager eventually leads to very good money. Money is good as an AE though, too(if you are making decent commission) I work hard to hit my number and make commission, which is one of the reasons why I wouldn’t necessarily become a manager. Base salary increases with the more revenue you bring in. Getting a wireless as an AE has made my day to day routine so much more fun and relaxed. Most managers aren’t as “micro-managey” as reviews say- I have just been lucky with the two I have had.","Despite what I said in the pros—it is pure luck of the draw with who you get as a manager. There are definitely some managers that will make you feel extremely pressured and make you feel as if you’re not doing good enough or working hard enough. If you don’t make a bare minimum of 80 calls a day— I have seen people get hounded by their managers. If you have anxiety-this job may certainly heighten it. If you want to call out sick—you will be questioned and pressured to come in. (Depending on who the manager, that is.) The biggest con is that since this is such high-stress, anxiety-provoking job, there is truly not enough PTO or sick days. You get 5 sick days a year. Five. I’m sorry but that is just not enough in this day in age. Many companies offer mental health days on top of sick days-which you think Yelp would offer due to the high stress of the job. Other sales companies also offer unlimited PTO “upon manager approval. Would be nice. Also, it is also hard to leave once you are here. Want to quit? Be prepared on getting sold to stay.","3.0

So it’s often being cursed out, which you have to answer with an “I understand, but...”, or hang ups as soon as you introduce yourself. The cold calling(borderline harassment) is what gives Yelp a bad name. Especially when you are calling a rural area for a company that just doesn’t need Yelp to prosper.

The job itself is essentially just harassing people over the phone to buy Yelp advertising. Your manager will make you call these poor business owners every other day (even if they tell you they aren’t interested repeatedly) and will pressure you into selling advertising to people that definitely don’t need it or are not a good fit for the program. If you express completely rational feelings like “I don’t want to bother this guy that has told me he doesn’t want to use our program 10 times” or “I don’t want to pressure this old lady into signing up this knitting business she runs out of her bedroom” then you will be met with ludicrous statements like “Yelp works for everyone” and “They need Yelp, they just don’t know it.” The office (at least the New York one) is also run by a bunch of young and immature managers that treat the sales floor like a hook up scouting area and gossip about their reps and each other. Many managers make inappropriate advances toward reps and generally nothing is done about it. Overall, you just feel like you’re bothering people all day and are pressured by your manager to meet sales goals that are reachable but painful. It’s not worth it, especially since it’s a cold calling role and doesn’t use a true sales process. You’d be better off finding a real sales job at a startup or somewhere that doesn’t force you to drink the corporate koolaid. The base pay is also pretty hard to live on in NYC and the commission structure is pretty lame (the commission checks aren’t worth the amount of stress). My main advice: Just don’t do it. Find a better role somewhere far, far away.","2.0

However inclusion of African Americans is non existent especially in management & leadership. Majority of the managers are Caucasian ranging from 23-27 years old and managing people from their same age group. These managers usually have little experience when it comes to race & how to overcome those challenges. It’s very high school like to an extent. Yelp isn’t ideal for someone with a family. Yes your hours are typically 9-5 with weekends & holidays off but they run incentives religiously. On any given Monday- Thursday there’s an incentive to a local bar or the kegs and god forbid you can’t attend, you are looked at as not being a team player or playing nice with others. The lengths they go to burn bridges with customers is a bad reflection on the employee who gains trust of the potential advertiser. Verbiage & discounts are very Gray area, borderline sketch usually ends in the customer ending their service & shunning yelp forever.

From day one I was told where I’d end up as a sales professional even though I was the best sales person on the floor and they had no idea what my abilities were. My managers had less sales experience then me and i could tell by the training and how they motivated the teams. Leaders are more focused on keeping top performers in their department to make them look good rather then advancing those who contribute major revenue to the company. If you go to the franchise department client partners and national enterprise sales will steal your deals that they never worked on. I spend 3 weeks on a deal that a client partner took because he owns the decision maker but the account was in my book. Your book in franchise is pitiful half of the accounts are national corporate accounts that you’re not allowed to close and if you do manage it close it the national rep with get nasty until they take the commission for it. Franchise works basically as glorified SDRs for the higher departments. You basically get the crumbs. Local gets paid more and their sale is a lot easier . They try to be secretive about it by having separate meetings but everyone in the organization is aware of it. Franchise leaders disrespect the AEs when they question their future with in the company. If you want to be a National AE or Midmarket AE regardless of how amazing you are .. you can forget it. Find a job somewhere else which most do after franchise because it’s the dead end department. The negative emails and peep talks are immature. The sales force lightening training is non existent. Corporate does a horrible job creating strong relationships with the companies you have to call which makes your job harder because you will have to fight through objections that come directly from the higher ups in the organization refusing to allow them to work with Yelp. The platform is about transparency in reviews and consumer feedback. However, it ironic because there is no transparency in the hiring and employment process within Yelp not accountability from leadership who purposefully stop great AEs from being successful. Transparency starts from with in a company and trickles down into all your processes and it doesn’t exist at Yelp. If you like sitting and making dials with zero change or opportunities .. just collecting a paycheck then this is the job for you!","1.0

Apply Here,I have been working at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"I can't say enough great things about this company. With the right tenacity and grit along with the right manager + director, this job has the potential to alter the course of your life in the most brilliant direction you've not yet dreamed of. Great perks right from from day one on the job, the people (yes the business owners you talk to are important but the reason that many people stay on the job is for the amazing people in the trenches that you're grinding day to day with), management and leadership in this office is top freaking notch (wow), Merch Mart is amazing and in a prime location, so many opportunities across the company (after becoming semi good at the job you have the ability to work out of any office, you have to prove you can be independent and do the job but working out of the DC or NYC office and feeling like a big boy and getting to see the city is life changing). Sure the kitchen is great, Yelp Cafe is amazing in every office. This company rocks, and its hilarious to read the negative reviews on this place. The negative reviews come from reps who were at lunch drinking the haterade and festering on negativity instead of surrounding themselves with positive people. If you walk away from this job and didn't learn anything useful for any other part of life, well I don't know what to tell you; you might not be doing life right.","My only cons are in regard to PTO and sick time. I do my job, I'm a great rep, and yet I feel like I have to walk at the pace of the slowest walker. There have been so many reps I've met or known of who have abused the system and by abusing the system you make it not fun for the rest of us. You have 5 sick days. 5. I'm passionate about positive mental health (and so is Yelp, I love the tools we're given with formerly Ginger IO and now a new tool that is rolling out into 2020), but I sometimes need a personal day or if I'm ahead on the month and I just need a break. To get that day I need to use a sick day or PTO. Then when you're maybe out of sick days at the end of the year and you actually get really sick, you're in a pickle :) If and when I ever leave the company it'll be because I don't get personal days and I sometimes feel like I can't take day or respite when I need it. But I do appreciate the muscle and habit of success I've built by working consistently, but maybe adding personal day time to reps who hit the AE level would incentivize top reps to stay who might be burnt out. I'd even trade 1 or 2 commission checks or PTO if I could! Time > Money any day. The 15 days of PTO is great and standard but not being able to go negative for same reasons of people abusing system is annoying but makes sense. These 2 cons are by no means reasons to not accept an offer to work at Yelp. What you learn here can change your life. Avoid negative and toxic people, run your own race, ask for feedback, be open to criticism and work your butt off and I promise this job will take you to places you could never imagine.","5.0

Mon Dec 23 2019 23:49:07 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), User Operations Associate,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Toxic environment, horrible management, zero growth",I worked at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"Stable paycheck and adequate entryway into tech industry Decent benefits (health, dental, and vision insurance as well as others, small wellness stipend, pre-tax commuter benefits, free snacks, free coffee/barista, bread, and lunch meats, summer and winter offsites and smaller team offsites, accrued PTO, paid holidays and 5 sick days) Relatively flexible schedule (come in between 7-10AM, couple work from home days granted using loaners) Smart and friendly co-workers, although can be cliquey Two SF Yelp buildings have a great location next to the SFMOMA and Yerba Buena Gardens, but the main building is better than the other Despite the repetitive and monotonous nature of the work, the content is easy to get through, so personal browsing is definitely doable","The biggest downfall of user ops is bad management who treats associates more like sweatshop workers than people, and is unreceptive to criticism. Work is very repetitive, and if you do better and more work than the average worker, you will be told to do even more of the same work. There's zero acknowledgment of top performers, and people they do acknowledge in meetings are picked based on a popularity contest instead of actual merit or metrics. Several top performers within this department have been given more work to do, and threatened to be fired if they did not do more than the requirements for anyone else. If you take on multiple projects, roles, and teams, your pay is the same as an associate that just onboarded. Whenever there's a backlog, management simply tells everyone to do an extra half an hour of work with no compensation or reward. The personalities of people here tend to be more introverted, so people prefer to conform and be silent rather than dispute obvious oppression from upper management. There's rampant favoritism, and the main way to advance is to brown nose your way in to a higher role. There's a specific instance of this that occurred despite mass disapproval of the floor. Shady things occurred, such as when there was excess budget, teams were given a chance to have a free meal. However, one team had their treat reduced to just a drink and the rest of the money disappeared. Even though you'll be welcomed by many friendly faces, after the fanfare ends, everyone mostly keeps to themselves and no one likes communicating outside of short pings, if even that. Almost all associates are introverted, which makes forced social gatherings a little more awkward and stiff. Everyone likes to express their discontentment privately instead of sharing it in one voice, which could make a difference as opposed to the one or two associates willing to rise against unfair actions from management. I've been in several startups and tech companies smaller and bigger than here, and can say that this is the most toxic environment I've ever experienced. Low morale is rampant and consistently expressed in whispers. Managers contribute a lot to this due to their demands and two-faced attitudes. They'll say ""We care for your mental health and well-being"" but the next day, say ""We have a problem because you didn't work enough for this one hour of the day"". Yes, management keeps track of every action associates do every hour of the day, when it's clearly advertised upon the start of the job that it's a weekly quota that can more or less fluctuate each day. Guess they had to make up something to do to keep the job, but I don't think creating this inherent distrust between management and associates is a great way to foster happy and loyal employees. The micromanagement is severe here, which is unconducive to productivity. If you're driven and intelligent, this is not your job. You will thrive if you just want to keep your head down and have a mediocre-paying job where you don't have to think about anything really. If you really love Yelp and want to go somewhere with it, this is not your job. Preference is given to external candidates for management positions, and middle-tier positions don't pay much more. If you want to improve the Yelp community, this is not your job. They hired aggressively politically correct people to ""improve"" the rules and most people on the floor were never Yelpers or foodies to begin with. They're basically outsourcing this role now though, so my current advisal would be for SF associates to quit before the impending mass layoff!","1.0

Though most of the management core was the mid-20s, the company is working hard to hire external, older adults with more life experience besides college and Yelp. Helpful. Know that you're making high-volume calls to men and women who mostly dislike your call because of the company name and have been called by reps almost every-month since their business has been on Yelp.com. So imagine being a business owner whose first rep called in 2014, they may have had close to 100 calls from 10 different reps trying to convince them to sign up for Yelp Advertisement. That's the job. Your Quota and Target numbers aren't delivering the same financial benefit that you would receive at other sales jobs. They don't mean anything except that they're a bar to hit. What counts are several dials and how many people you can get to sign up for ads, even if they don't stay with Yelp long term. The job is exhausting and mundane. You're ""battling it out"" with owners, ""empowering"" their employees to sign up the business in the place of the owner, and your goal is to complete the entire sales process in 30 min. Hopefully, you get a territory that's vibrant with new business and not a region of America, where the population is dwindling and businesses are closing their doors (i.e. New England). Your Q and T aren't based upon region, everyone's Q and T is the same based upon how long you've worked here. My suggestion-talk with reps who have worked here for 2+ years and are still AE and ask for honest opinions about how much they enjoy their role and if they are looking for a different job. Recruiters give you an idea of how much the average rep makes during their tenure, but they don't tell you how many people have left the company during that same period.","3.0

I started my career as an Account Executive and quickly worked my way to the national side of the business. The company felt like it was in a slow decline throughout my tenure, which was consistently confirmed by taking a quick look at the stock price after earnings calls. The Account Executive role is challenging and continues to get harder as better advertising options (Facebook, Google, etc.) are available. You spend the majority of your day cold calling business owners who have been called HUNDREDS of times by past AE's which leads to plenty of rejection and negative days. I worked as an Account Executive for just about a year before moving to the national side of the business. You would think to move from local to national would result in a pay increase, and at Yelp, you would be sadly mistaken. The national business is broken, which has resulted in an exodus of many top reps over the years, and to be honest, it makes sense. Who uses Yelp to find a Subway? I was able to move out of the national business into a local client partner role where you work with business owners post-sale to upgrade their programs. This role was decent for a few years, but the management in that department became unbearable. You don't have to work somewhere where 30-year-old managers spend 6 hours instant messaging with each other. Also, you truly learn in that role that the Yelp advertising product isn't great, but you are forced to ask your clients to upgrade regardless. This message is for both people considering Yelp as a career and current employees. There are MUCH better options available. I have been so happy since leaving Yelp, and you can be too! I remember reading Glassdoor reviews of Yelp while I was an employee just for confirmation that I wasn't the only one feeling so down on the company. The Glassdoor reviews speak for themselves! You are better than a company that is about to drop below three stars. You don't need to be stressing yourself out every day because business owners have been called 1,000 times and don't care about your scripted sales pitch. You don't have to work for a company where managers instant message each other all day and then yell at your team when you are behind. Life is too short to be unhappy in the workplace.","1.0

You will be micromanaged to death. You will be thrown to the curb at any Machiavellian moment. Management is setup to seem like you are a friend and you are a meaningful being to the Yelp machine but the second you aren't helping them they will toss you aside. This job is a boiler room with fanfare but you can put lipstick on a pig. You are better off scamming people on the L than working for this company because ultimately they are the same. Managers don't take no for an answer. This ISN'T a sales job. This is a pressure someone until they submit job, and if that what you're into then go sell used cars, at least people who are buying cars know what they are walking into. People are going to try and go around you to get you in trouble just because it might make them look good. Unless you fall on the far right side of the bell curve you will not matter to Yelp. 

They aim for fresh college kids that don't know any better, and if you get this job, take a look around, count the people over 30

There are way better opportunities in Chicago. Avoid this. It's a dying platform. If you drink the kool aid you might think otherwise but honestly when was the last time you used Yelp to find a plumber? You haven't, no one has. Yelp rips off small businesses.

Many people who I started with are already successful senior managers and enterprise reps only after 4-5 years. It’s incredible how fast the company grows. The perks and benefits are like no other.

Tue Oct 22 2019 11:47:12 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Sales Manager,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Overall, I owe a lot to this company and office specifically for where I am at in my career",I worked at Yelp full-time for more than 3 years,"I'll preface this by saying this is a bona fide sales role, and if you've got the grit to make it as a salesperson I would wager there are very few offices in the city better suited to grow your skillset and make money than the Yelp office in the merchandise mart. If you don't, you will hate it, and hate sales in general, so save yourself some grief and look elsewhere. Also, the opportunity for upward mobility is without ceiling. There is a promotion at any point in time available for you if you earn/deserve it in this office. It is a meritocracy. The training, both from an individual contributor level all the way up the leadership ladder, is simply world class. I spent 3 years here after school, moving from the AE role up to a mid level management role and genuinely feel as though I earned an MBA in Business, Sales, and Management/Leadership after I departed. The accountability levels are strong and direct but in most cases very genuinely postured to foster growth and development in the best interest of the report. The culture is strong and incredibly diverse ate just about every level - not just in the IC unit. I left on very good terms and am still in touch with my former reports and directors and from a sales capacity absolutely recommend giving Yelp heavy consideration. It is also worth noting the consistent and aggressive improvement model in terms of the tech and the product - the engineers are constantly innovating and rolling out improvements which says a lot about the company.","No company is perfect but there are definitely some items I feel need to be addressed. For example, after I left the company, my team was broken up (15 reps) without any consideration as to where they might want to land team wise - almost dispersed at random. Bear in mind this was a top team with experienced reps and now, in the 3 months I have left, I believe 4 have left the company and most have 1 foot out the door. My second point of contention with the company is the HR office. Without going into too much detail, there was a point in my career as a manager where I felt aggressively and personally attacked (and in many ways I was at fault) by the head of HR as well as the office head. There seems to be a lack of behavioral standardization from the management/rep level from HR. For example, while I was *moderately* in the wrong, I was by no means on any path to termination. As a result I was very close to quitting at that time in a less than ceremonious way - I am okay with admitting to being at fault, but the way in which I was dealt with was incredibly beyond the scope of what is acceptable. That being said, the rest of my experiences at Yelp and with the Office Head were so excellent that I am glad I did not move on and I look at the company and office with a favorable lens.","4.0

The training is great.","Dead platform. Seriously ask yourself, do you even use Yelp? Yes everyone knows what Yelp is but how often do you even use it? My training class was 109 people and all the people I talked to couldn't say that they had ever used it. This office alone has 900 salesmen on the floor, and there are 4 other offices. So lets call it around 4,000 reps nationwide. That's 4,000 people making 80 dials each to a relatively finite amount of businesses. The leads you are calling have been called to death. You will often be told to ""eff off"" or ""NO THANKS"" and hung up abruptly. Yelp is on the decline...refer back to the question, ""do you even use Yelp?"". The management hires en masse because the turnover rate is ridiculously high. The training period of two months is great but once you're finished with that you are in sink/swim mode and that's when a vast majority of people in my training class quit. The thing about hiring en masse means you can let people go without thinking and therefore the employees are just numbers. You will be encouraged to skip your lunch, skip breaks, and come in/stay late. The compensation structure isn't great. You need to make 42k for Yelp before you see a nickel of commission. This company capitalizes on taking kids right out of college, working them to the point of quitting, and setting up a pay structure that ensure Yelp gets all the money. The people on the right of bell curve, i.e. the 1% earners are given the leads of people that leave the company, aka they have a way better chance of staying at the top. Again. This boils down to one thing. People don't use Yelp. Don't let them fool you. Seriously, ask 5 people you know if they use Yelp. They don't. If they do, it's for restaurants but guess what, 90% of the businesses you call do not fall in that parameter. You're going to be calling doctors, lawyers, roofers, cleaning services...etc. When was the last time you used Yelp to find a lawyer? Exactly, no one does. If you are looking to pad your resume, this is a great place holder. The 2 months of paid training is great and you will be able to find a job easily after that. I wouldn't stick around.","1.0

During my time here at Yelp, managers religilously shoved a corny sales script down our throats. They were so adamant that the script would be the key to our success. WRONG! The script did me no good when I would get cussed out by angry business owners because I am the 5th person from Yelp to call them. In training, managers will tell you that you cannot get fired for job performance. They told us that they know this job is hard but as long as we're trying and making an effort, you will be ok no matter what. Their exact words were "" It's not a matter of IF you become a good salesperson but WHEN."" That was a whole lie..I got fired for my performance but I'll get to that later. Managers are really big on metrics. Daily metrics were 75-80 COLD CALLS a day, send 15 emails, have 2.25 hours of talk time, pitch 2 times and close one deal. If you were falling short on any of your metrics, be prepared to have a micro-managing manager down your back. They'll really be on your case if you are not pitching or closing deals. Managers need to understand that sales is like a rollercoaster. You are going to have good and bad days but for some reason, they can't comprehend that logic. The office vibe can be fake at times. Fake success stories , fake smiles, fake energy, just FAKE! Everyone is miserable and burnt out. I've seen people cry in bathrooms because the job got tough. If you do not have thick skin going into this job, you better develop it because you are constantly being tested. As I mentioned earlier, managers said you can't fired for job performance. You are more likely to get fired for breaking one of Yelps CORE values rather than performance. Yelp must've had a bad Q3 because after they told us how company revenue declined, that's when upper management (Directors, Vice President , etc..) started putting employees on performance plans. If you were not hitting quota ($20K/month), then you were on the plan. They give you 2-3 months to course correct, otherwise, you're fired! They use scare tactics to motivate you to do better but it only diminishes your self esteem. You're being pulled into 3-4 one on one meetings throughout the day. How do you expect me to improve if I'm in meetings 24/7. Word of advice, if you like a cult like culture, micro management, and getting cussed out, then be my guest, Yelp is your oyster.

Fri Oct 11 2019 08:45:49 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Senior Account Executive,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Definitely a 2 star career,I have been working at Yelp full-time for more than a year,- You can certainly learn a lot about cold calling by working here. Definitely a crash course in cold calling. - Free snacks and drinks. Saved a few bucks each day with the barista and kitchen. - Great insurance. - Lots of great coworkers at the office that are fun to be around. - I have still never once been bothered outside of work.,"- Management creates a terrible environment here. Extreme micromanagement of each metric. The directors that I've dealt with are awful. One in particular tries to be very Radical with what they do and it's a joke. Makes me wonder what my career opportunities are here. I try to look at what my career would be like if I were to stay at Yelp for 5+ years and become a director. It appears that my job duties would be sitting at a desk all day and hitting refresh on a report. Over and over and over again. Then I'll get up and scream something that only I think is funny. I’ll look around desperately to see if someone laughed so I know I’m getting attention. If I want to get really crazy I can high kick or walk around with an inflatable phone. Or double the fun and do both!! Then maybe I'll start making boomerangs to send to everyone and we’ll really start closing deals. Those are management skills here. - The sales tactics here are awful. As stated in pros above, you will have a crash course in cold calling. It's really sink or swim because every single person you talk to on the phone hates you and hates Yelp. If you have a brain, it's hard to believe in a product that every single client hates. - Managers are a joke. They're so young and seriously have no other experience. Congrats, you've memorized a script and you're good at misleading people. They will also barge your calls and tell you what to say, but it's your fault if what they say doesn't close the deal. Kind of comical tbh. It’d be funnier if it didn’t affect my paycheck. I don’t blame the managers though. It’s pressure passed down from the directors.","2.0

Being able to laugh and have fun with your friends and get paid to do so is ultimately why I know I stayed so long and loved working at yelp. Free food If you stay for 2+ years looks amazing on your resume and opens a lot of doors for you at other major companies.,"Let’s start with the pay You have offices in major cities and you do not pay a livable wage. Although I have heard they have improved there chargeback policy’s People who would be constant producers went months with out commission because of they way chargeback were set up. Pay your employees accordingly, focus on finding an additional way to compensate based on retaining accounts since employees get penalized if they don’t and you won’t have such high turn over and people would probably produce more because they don’t have to stress about surviving. They have remote teams and sometime last year they cut everyone’s pay. If you were a senior you took almost a 10k pay cut. What they should of done is everyone currently in remote keeps there salary and everyone who joined after follows the new compensation plan rules. Culture This is a prop and con... the con of it is if you at all act like a human rather then the puppies and rainbow sales machine they want you to be you ultimately get labeled “negative” which is like having a scarlet letter on you. This is very much HS/college 2.0 everyone sleeps with eachother managers are sleeping with reps directors with managers etc... favoritism is alive and well I’ve witnessed it on many spectrums and have witnessed throughout my 4yrs on several occasions people of color getting treated unfairly and ultimately pushed out. There solution now is hiring every person of color who is mildly successful in the role and the VP of sales makes it a point to be there cheerleader which no one finds motivational or sincere. Leadership Hit or miss I myself have had a manager make me feel horrible because I didn’t stay late or couldn’t participate in team offsites, a manager who treated me like a number, and managers who genuinely cared and believed in me it’s really just luck of the draw but if your lucky enough to get a quality manager your experience at yelp will be amazing. Until it’s not... my last manager was a rep who was promoted and had no idea what he was doing. I spoke up a few time constructively to my director and even HR on how this is not working out when I asked to switch teams I was met with a firm no and now I have a target on my back. The stress alone was killing me and now after 4 years and going through an up and down phase in my career (which happens in sales and after being consistent for over a year) and missing my number after 2 months I was on the other side of the table where my contributions and dedication to the company were not taken into consideration I was just a number who they rather get rid of cause once your an elite or tenured enough they don’t care really if you leave because it won’t effect managers retention bonuses if you churn at that point. So there I was no support no guidance and unforntently I was so wrapped up with trying to get off this team I sunk my own ship and after 4 years of giving my life to a company I loved just like that they let me go even tho I was still performing. Better then at least 4 other people on my team and the very next month my manager ended up getting demoted but I lose my job .... nice move yelp. If you are a successful rep stay in local for at least 2 years... if you move prepare for a pay cut. I have no idea why but everyone I know who was a successful rep ( 30-40k consistently) and took a promotion took a pay cut for about 3-6 months if not more so which defies the purpose of a promotion. If you go into leadership or national do it cause you are passionate about the company and want to further your career not if you are in it to make money. Lastly you are %1000000 going to hate the job anyone says they love there job really means they love who they work or for. No one wants to make 80-100 calls a day get hung up on, yelled at, cursed at, etc. if you do then yelp is the place for you. Do not have loyalty to this company because they are not loyal to you. Your are very much so just a number to them even when you feel like you are not, you are. If you are lucky to get a non sales role make sure you die at yelp cause it really is a great atmosphere to work in when you are surrounded by the right people.","1.0

You might make a few friends.,"So I managed to stay here longer than I wanted to, but the truth is that I wanted to quit 3 days into the job though I lasted 10 months. Every day felt the same, vet 10 in, kick 10 out, have a round-up where the same goals and topics about reaching business owners are repeated non-stop, and make calls for 8 hours a day. I felt like I was stuck in a never-ending loop. Whenever someone on my team got on a call and went to the first live search, managers would barge in and feed us lines which, at the end of the call, they would congratulate us for fighting the business owner and defending the company even though we said the lines they fed us word for word. Speaking about managers, many of them; if they had worked for another company; would've been fired for acting like children or college freshman and the incentives they gave out were also childish at best (Make a 3.24 before noon and get a breakfast sandwich or be out at 2 PM? Am I in elementary school?). I endured plenty of stress and panic attacks, including having two of them within 24 hours, just to stay afloat in this job for a paycheck that's laughable with a commission structure that isn't all that's promised along with a business model that needs to be updated and not centered around harassing business owners every two days. Plus the opportunities to advance are thin unless you want to be calling mid-size businesses with 5-9 locations, national businesses or be a manager in the hopes you roll out with a team of new hires into the vet org.","2.0

Wed Oct 09 2019 06:04:43 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Enterprise Sales Director,,Former Employee ,"Do you like constant re-orgs, salary changes and poor management? Join Yelp.",I worked at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"- I worked with some wonderful, intelligent and truly talented people that are still close friends today. Most of whom have all left Yelp. - If you get handed the right accounts from management there is opportunity to make decent commission.","Where to begin... - Yelp can change your job responsibilities, salary and title at any time - something I have never seen or heard of in my 14 years in digital advertising. I had my salary changed 3 times in a period of a year and a half and was forced to moved into new business sales even though I was hired to manage existing clients. - With the new hybrid structure, you could be handed an account list and actually start in a deficit towards your sales goal (that you're expected to makeup despite it having nothing to do with anything you did) while your colleague next to you could be handed a large upsell that was not theirs. I still believe this has to be somehow illegal and is by far the most unethical thing I have seen to date in any sales org. -Management of the enterprise org all ""grew up"" at Yelp and it's very obvious. They lack any knowledge of how the rest of the industry works and have a local sales mentality to the way they manage. They also are given total power, whether they have earned it or not, and reps are not validated or listened to. Adding to this, the manager of our region lacked professionalism, sales acumen/experience and lead from emotion. This person was petty, vindictive and reported to HR by multiple employees with no action taken. After 8 people from a small team left (many without jobs lined up) and a year+ of not hitting performance goals - not sure how this person still holds their position. - The product is so far behind where the rest of the industry is. Yelp does not play nicely with attribution methodology, media mix modeling or any form of advanced data analytics. Also Facebook and Google have both now created superior/competitive products. - At the enterprise level you often lack control over your own accounts...particularly franchise accounts as local/franchise reps are calling/harassing on individual locations on almost a daily basis. - This is a common theme in Glassdoor reviews, but if you don't drink the Yelp kool-aid, play the game or dare to question management on decisions/choices you will be the one with consequences. - The majority of the enterprise org was put on performance plans in Q3...despite it mostly being due to extremely unrealistic sales goals set by management for 2019 coupled with a complete re-org this past January forcing reps into new roles and account lists. - The Yelp offices reminded me of the Wolf of Wall Street. Music blasting over speakers, gongs being struct all day by the local sales teams, team roundups in the hallway, employees crying in the bathroom. It was a highly disruptive and unprofessional environment.","1.0

Wed Sep 11 2019 14:28:19 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,"Sometimes fun, mostly terrible and traumatic!",I worked at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"- Will hire right out of college - Great sales training, will look good on your resume and prepare you for a more mature sales role (if that's what you want) - Start-up amenities (Snacks, happy hours, ping pong tables, etc.) if you are young and new to the city, Yelp can also be your social life. - GREAT health insurance","Oh boy, where to begin... - Base pay is laughable for NYC, commission structure does not net most people a consistent commission (because the advertising product is shabby, but more on that later) - The office is aggressively loud. Bad EDM music pumping 24/7 (sometimes the same playlist 3 times a day for a week straight), managers shouting to get everybody ""hyped"", every deal closed mean a huge gong is hit and everybody cheering. It's neurotic and not normal, and certainly not conducive to a healthy work environment. - Zero professionalism and a ton of gossip, including directors and VPs. - You have to work hard. Always. Which is something I pride myself on doing. But, no matter how well or terrible you are doing in terms of revenue, at every turn your manager and director will say whatever they can to squeeze more work out of you. - From clock in to clock out, (most) managers will micro-manage and manipulate you to the point of exhaustion. The company tries to put all of the onus and responsibility on the lowly sales person, ignoring large flaws in the companies structure. - Team meetings consisted of soulless locker room motivational speeches, relating the task of hitting your target revenue to your own life, motivations, and goals. It all was very brain-washy. It was not an option to treat Yelp like a job, it had to be your life. - Weeks are peppered in with ""incentives"" if you hit certain metrics. Some were cool, like PTO and lunch, some we're absolutely inane, like crabwalking races and stuffing oreos in your mouth. Felt like a summer camp for middle schoolers. - Most business owners have an opinion on Yelp. Some love it, but most HATE Yelp. Most of my days, towards the end of my time there, I was constantly dealing with owners who were confused/angry about how Yelp shows and hides certain reviews. Yelp's assertive review filtering, in place to discourage fake or solicited reviews, does not always do its job correctly. There is no recourse for this, and the brunt of the feelings business owners had we're lain upon the outbound sales teams. - The ad product works okay in metropolitan areas, and mostly with a few key industries. It was pretty easy to sell to them with conviction. However, for every other business, where there is little user activity, most of the time I was forced to lie to their face, give general (misleading) fact and figures about the effect of the program, and try and get them to put a card on file that would slowly drain money out of their accounts as people would click on their ad then not buy. - Work life balance is ""important"" to Yelp, but again, in name only. AEs were encouraged (pressured) to stay late at the end of every month. Even though I never had to check my email or work late into the night most days, the sheer anxiety that the job fosters is impossible to let go of in your free time. IN SUMMARY: Yelp's ""culture"" is a wolf is sheep's clothing. Like a certain politician the USA has in office, if Yelp is trying to convince you of something, the opposite is probably true. From day ONE, management will try and convince you how great of a company Yelp is, how much we're changing the lives of business owners, and how lucky you should feel being at the company. The reality I saw, was the employees we're mostly upset or burnt out (even the successful ones), the company has been declining since 2015, and (I can't say this enough) the stressful conditions and work environment, emotional manipulation from mgmt, and the fact that I spent my day lying to people is NOT NORMAL. IF YOU ARE APPLYING to Yelp, ask yourself: Do I want a career in sales? Do I not care about having autonomy at my workplace? Can I deal with constant noise, stimuli, and immature colleagues? If you answered no to any of these, I encourage you to look elsewhere.","2.0

Tue Sep 10 2019 12:37:46 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Amazing Company. Management and Training Needs Improvement.,I worked at Yelp full-time for less than a year,"I was excited to get hired at such a big name company. The hours, benefits, wellness program, office design are all amazing. Excellent opportunities and low cost for helping small business grow, I believe in that strongly. I still recommend the advertisements to friends and family.","The training caused so much anxiety for me. I was going through my own personal issues and thought this job was a dream come true. Left personal things at home and succeed at work. However, all it did was pile on top of my anxiety. I came to work dressed professionally and clean and my coworkers were wearing short shorts with their butts showing. The training style is more of a “work first, train later”. Basically you are on the phones with real accounts, calling real people with real objections, that you cannot answer because the training session comes after the failures. If you are a perfectionist, or if you are like me and really really wanted to do well, that can be stressful. As the weeks continue you will then receive the remainder of the sales script and other training materials, and how to respond to these advertising objectives, and you still have to call back the same accounts in your pipeline, the same people who knew you had no clue what you were talking about the first few calls because you could not properly answer their questions, due to not having completed training. I would rather have the materials I need prior to working, prior to having the phone hung up on me. I starting making calls to small business owners the first week on the job. Training started after the calls started. The training was 8 weeks total. Each group of about 8 people or so were assigned a training manager for the day, and every day for about 1-2 max, we were giving the training materials little by little. However, the manager I had (Mike) took 2 weeks vacation out of the 8 weeks of training we had. So basically training for my group was only 6 weeks. The atmosphere felt like a frat house. He would come to work smelling like he went drinking last night then woke up and threw on the same smelly t-shirt. He would fraternize with the coworkers that wore short shorts and ignore the others. I would raise my hand and get completely ignored to the point I would go home and study my training material over and over afraid of messing up. He was supposed to monitor our calls and that happened for me maybe once or twice. I was left on my own. Even closed my first and second sale on my own with no proper guidance. While he was on vacation, he left us with no one to train us. He pretty much told us to call upon the other trainers who had their own new hire group when we needed his help. I noticed one of the other trainers, I believe his name was Aja, seemed to want everyone on his team to do well and always seemed professional and ready to work. I wish I was on his team. I didn’t want to say much because they hired about 5% people of color and I didn’t want to labelled as difficult. It felt like if you weren’t down to go drinking with them, you wouldn’t get the proper monitoring and attention that you needed to succeed. When I brought this to his attention, he stated I should’ve told him sooner, seemed genuinely concerned and seemed to genuinely want to help and I thought that was the end of it. But no way, my next call, I was completely ignored again. The short shorts wearing coworker, whom sat right next to me seemed to have all of his attention sometimes for over an hour on one call but I could not get 10 mins of his attention. After I regrettably left the company, my personal stress on top of the anxiety they gave me, short shorts and the other frat/ sorority group buddies started stalking my social media account. However, they did not follow me, which was so weird and childish. One of them posted a vulgar comment on one of my family vacation pictures. Offering to give me Vitamin D (aka his male genitals). Again I said nothing because I didn’t want to seem difficult and I wanted to come back to the company. However, I was marked as non rehirable, (I have no clue why). When I was the one treated poorly in what I thought would be my dream Job and Company. It sucks but you live and you learn.","2.0

Good benefits. Convenient location off the brown line. Biggest pro: Working here will make you realize these pros don’t make a job worthwhile to stay at. Makes you appreciate the next job you get much more.,"Yelp is kinda like one of those religious cults. They are great at recruiting recent college graduates (people looking for that great opportunity to give their life more security and pride in their job). And/or people who don’t know what it’s like to work for a company, full-time, doing work you actually enjoy. That was me. Ah, young and inexperienced in the career world. The managers and directors need a philosophy, a “motivating cause” to keep employees holding on to the belief that this all-day cold calling and subjecting yourself to hostile phone conversations is worth it. To achieve that, they will tell you over and over that it takes “dedication, tenacity, belief in yourself and your potential” etc, to succeed. That yelp will “transform your business skills to lead to bigger and better opportunities.” That those who leave, give up on themselves too early. Okay, maybe a little cold calling experience helps with your confidence and verbal skills - but all day, every? At that point, it’s no longer about your career growth, it’s mainly about their financial business incentives - the need for businesses to buy advertising so the company can sustain. Yeah, you make money too. But you can make more elsewhere at a place with better dynamics. Even if you make a little less, it’s probably worth it over the day-to-day grinding it out at Yelp. They need you to be an efficient cog in the wheel. To make you that “cog,” they need you to believe that all the cold calling, the subjecting yourself to the anger of business owners, is for a good cause. “Not only will you grow for the better, but you’ll be helping business owners in the process.” Through all those daily calls, you’re attempting to “educate” business owners on how yelp advertising will help transform their business. If you’re good enough at sales (or “better than the last sales rep,” who’s called them 20 times before you) “they’ll be willing to listen.” And when they do, they’ll sign up for yelp advertising and get more business. It’s a win-win! But truthfully, the data Yelp uses to “prove” its advertising effectiveness is presented in a skewed, misleading way. I don’t think most research universities wouldn’t back it if it were presented as an argument in a paper. Sure, yelp advertising probably does help some businesses. But all? Most? Nah. You either have mostly good reviews or you don’t. Thats what really helps or hurts a business. Adversity your business page with bad reviews won’t help you. Advertising your page if you have good ones might a little. But why spend money on advertising on yelp when your good reviews are what sell themselves? Plus, it’s too expensive with little proof in the data that it actually helps for the cost. Despite what the data charts show on a business owners’ profile, it’s simply not backed by reliable numbers or data to make it worthwhile for these small business owners. There is a reason why turn over is so high at Yelp. And it’s not because people simply “give up on themselves too early.” Do your mental health a favor and work elsewhere. If you work there currently, trust your gut and leave when you know you want to. Those who stay a long time and actually thrive at Yelp in sales are usually people who are good at being self-centered and see the arguments with business owners as an “us against them” (Plus, they don’t want to face the fact that the job sucks). Believe it’s worth it and it will be easier, right? Grind for a few “wins.” Do it again tomorrow. Like most who leave, eventually you find the daily repetition simply isn’t worth it.","2.0

Leaving Yelp and gaining outside work experience has truly made me realize just how toxic that work environment was, and, from what I hear, continues to be because of the head of office and director clique. - Lack of diversity. This has been continuously messaged in other reviews, but, being on the inside of leadership gave me a glimpse into just how messed up this was. People were made to feel uncomfortable based on their language preference/ethnicity, and I have seen notes from directors to managers in which they've messaged with no tact or context that we need to promote POC- it was messaged with an eyeroll and an obvious feeling of obligation versus true intent to diversify the sales org. - Bullying/harassment from leadership/management. tant, aggressive intimidation tactics used to make sure reps were in line, but also to politicize the manager/leadership environment- myself and multiple managers would be pulled into rooms to basically try and get dirt on other managers in a way that seemed extremely out of line. HR was never present for these conversations. Additionally, in fear of retaliation (office head said in a meeting, verbatim, ""I will find you"") this was never reported. - Unprofessionalism/frat culture. Managers and directors, some who've even gone on to be promoted to office heads/etc, would be out partying with reps- including binge drinking and recreational drug usage. Leadership would actually ask insubordinates for drugs while at happy hours, etc. Also, everyone has wildly inappropriate relationships, lines are constantly blurred and crossed, and it's all rooted in behavior from the top that trickled down. - No leadership with respectable outside work experience. None of the directors have any experience working outside of Yelp- while initially it was encouraging that Yelp promoted mostly internally, as you move up the ranks, you realize that you do not have anyone to look up to that actually has a decent roster of experience. Other companies hire externally to embrace other perspectives and diversity in experience, but Yelp does not seem to value that. In turn, their manager attrition is awful- people do not quit companies, they quit people, and the directors here (all of whom only have Yelp as 1st job out of college) are hired mostly based on politics and numbers that are inflated from playing a good political game. - Micromanagement. Ditto everything in other reviews about reps not being treated like adults. This ties in the frat culture/unprofessionalism. I can respect running a tight ship, but breathing down reps/managers necks and/or constantly pinging for updates/giving threats is not how it should be done.","2.0

Fri Sep 27 2019 00:30:57 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,, ,Beware,I worked at Yelp,Being downtown Chicago is pretty cool I guess.,"I don’t even know where to begin. You make 80 plus calls a day to small business owners. Doesn’t sound too bad right? Well to my surprise the business owners are just recycled accounts from passed reps that have already been called thousands of times already which was not stated in my interview. So you can only imagine how furious they’re going to be when you call them. But the managers preach to just keep calling them because persistency is key..no you’re just being a pest now. The “sales” tactics are just inhumane and they try to brain wash you like you’re doing a good thing by trying to manipulate you with these fake success stories. Calling these business owners several and I mean SEVERAL times a week. The managers preach not to look at the notes and just call them when in the notes it says they clearly don’t want yelp. So I call them, and you know what happens...yeah they still don’t want it from when they said no back in 2013 from the last rep and many more before me that called them that left it in the notes. And to make it worse you’re getting disrespected and yelled at by them. But you can’t blame the business owners because I see where they’re coming from being called thousands of times. And you can’t put them in the do not call list unless they say those words exactly. I remember it was my first day of training I was super excited to start because I didn’t know what I was in for. This isn’t my first corporation job either so I know how work culture is suppose to be like. Boy was I wrong. I remember exactly, my second week on the phones you’re suppose to do 80 calls and 2 hours of talk time. I had about 50 calls wasn’t sure about my talk time but I got scolded by the sales trainee manager Paul. Asked me if I wanted to be here and was questioning me and was comparing me to other people and even went to the lengths of telling me I was stealing money from the company because I wasn’t hitting my numbers yet WHEN IT WAS MY 2ND WEEK. During that meeting he really tried to break me and make me cry...I just laughed in his face because I knew what he was trying to do. Boy did that tick him off..but you don’t say that to someone “stealing money from the company” especially in the “professional setting” if I would even call it that. But come on it was my 2ND WEEK. He really tried to use scare tactics and things along the lines of those boundaries to get the way he wants. And I know I was not the only person he did that too. You’re suppose to develop me not try and break me already. That really brought it into perspective that they don’t care about you as a person. They see you as a dialing machine. They also micro manage you like you’re a baby that cannot act on its own. tantly breathing down your neck about being the dialing machine you are. Treating you like a kid. They come up with these kid like incentives like “who ever gets the most pitches or transaction get foods, a coffee, or you get to pie me in the face, a picture of your fav celebrity on the wall etc.” like come on grow up. I saw right through all that. The culture there is like a high school. Super cliquey and if you’re not hitting your numbers you’re a nobody there and give them even more of a reason to micro manage you eventually putting you on a plan to leave. Although don’t let this scare you away from sales if that’s what you want to do. Yelps tactics just aren’t morally right and the way they select manager is ridiculous. And this is just my experience there. If you want the job take it, but please beware.","1.0

I enjoyed the work I was doing and liked my office teammates.","If you don't fit the Yelp demographic (20-something, college grad, little or no actual work experience), be prepared to be singled out and put on notice for such things as going to the restroom more than once a day. God forbid don't actually speak your mind or you'll be looked at like you've got 2 heads. Onboarding/ orientation was non-existent. It took almost 2 weeks to get all the equipment and tools I needed to do the job. I was reprimanded for coming in late when I was told to report at 9am. Making travel arrangements was a joke and good luck getting reimbursed. It would have been nice to have Yelp on my CV but no way am I drinking that koolaid. Parking was a hassle since there is only room for about half of the employees. Manager was woefully inadequate; felt like I was the one doing the training.

When I started at Yelp many years ago I didn't know what I wanted out of a career and I didn't know what I wanted to do. A friend of mine referred me to work at Yelp and I thought I would give it a shot. 5 years later I have grown from someone who had no idea what they wanted to do into a sales professional that has experienced and learned so much about sales, leadership and received many promotions along the way. Yelp will teach you how to sell, how to lead (if management is something you are interested in) and will give you the tools to be successful. If you bring work ethic and a positive attitude Yelp is a great place for anyone to have a career.",Like most corporate environments there are politics. This could potentially get in the way of people deserving of promotions. Best thing to do is to always play well with others and stay out of the way of any drama.

Wed Aug 14 2019 16:33:47 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,This review is for future potential employees and current mgmt... Most of these 5 star reviews are clearly fake as well.,I have been working at Yelp full-time for less than a year,"First I'd like to say that I do not feel a lot of the reviews here are honest. How is it possible that several people all on the same day just so happen to write 5 star reviews, and they are doing it every day? There aren't that many people at Yelp who love their job. Anyway let's dive in, this is going to be a long one but if you're considering working somewhere, you should know what you're getting into. 1. The other account executives and some managers we work with are great, they truly make the job bearable. 2. The perks are decent, besides health insurance you get a nice subsidy for a health expense every month (massage, gym, etc), barista in house. Could really do with more vacation time... 5 days a year is not ok. Especially since we're making cold calls all day, if you are sick and need to take 2 days off you're pretty much screwed for the rest of the year. 3. Yelp does help SOME businesses and can be an OK advertising platform for about 20% of the businesses who exist. The other 80% do not need it, yet Yelp will force it down their throat (to be continued in cons). 4. You really do get some great sales experience here, it just sucks that you are selling a product that everyone hates and publicly blasts on Facebook and every other platform. (Yelp, why the heck would you advertise on Facebook when you just keep getting tons and tons of negative comments? It is not a good look for you or the employees who work for you). 5. Yelp is a big company and a well known name, should help you out when you eventually look for your next opportunity, unless of course that opportunity is in a restaurant or small business.","Now this is really the important part, because no matter how great the people you work with are, the job flat out sucks. You are cold calling businesses all day when 99% of them don't want to talk to you and strongly dislike Yelp. You know you're cold calling going into it at least, but that doesn't make it easier. 1. I came into this job thinking there was upward mobility because a lot of the reviews said there was. There isn't. You can move into a sales manager role where you just manage sales reps and get on sales calls and tell people what to say, and there is mid-market sales. It doesn't really seem like people EVER move into mid-market sales except maybe once a year, and even then, it's essentially the same job but instead of forcing small business owners to spend money on a program that probably won't work for them, you're selling advertising to businesses with several locations who might actually benefit but most of them still hate Yelp and won't see a positive ROI. 2. Just like any advertising, it doesn't work for everyone. But at Yelp, they try to brain wash you to sell to every single business that comes into your pipeline. If a business already advertised and they say it didn't work, you're taught to persuade them into trying it again, most are wise enough to say enough is enough. You have to continue calling the business over and over and if you only call it once they say that you need to call it more. 3. Micro managing. They try to make it a serious job and emphasize that it is not a college environment, yet they constantly micro manage your every move to the point where you aren't even allowed to have your cell phone out on your desk. Sounds like a classroom to me. 4. Retention. Now this is a clear issue, and if the higher ups at Yelp had any sense, they'd really try to understand why people leave after 2-3 months so regularly. The job sucks, and it is mentally stressful and emotionally draining when you have distressed business owners yelling at you all day for calling them. You need to be more compassionate to your employees and understanding rather than just worrying about metrics 24/7. You make some great friends at Yelp but if you end up ,making it more than a few months, most of them will probably be gone.","2.0

Your role is to push a business owner to buy through any means necessary. Often it will border on unethical or cross the line totally. Their advertising program simply does not work. I was over quota ever month I was there but nearly every client canceled within the first month. The company only requires you have a client retention rate of 19% which is less than 1 in every 5. That's LOW. Most of the businesses that I called have been reached out contact by email or calls over 100 times in the last year or 2. Many of those business owners are frustrated or angry with our called. I was told several times to stop harassing them. Managers will tell you not to put them on the do not call list unless they EXPLICITLY say the exact words. For example: a business owner told me to 'take me off your list to call and never call me again' but my manager directed me not to put them on DNC list. This happened multiple times and is the accepted practice there. Training managers are focused on their own development and it can really be transparent if they get frustrated at you. Though I tried not to take it seriously when it happened because they were new to managing people. You're encouraged to fight with business owners. Its really bizarre. The reputation of Yelp is really bad. After joining another company everyone heard from either a business owner, former employee or somewhere about their sales practices. Territory burnout is in full throttle and it's becoming hard to find people who having had bad experiences with Yelp or canceled once already or have been called 100 times. You will be calling the same businesses 6 times every each month or 2. Executive management is pushing the sales teams very hard to hit growth numbers. Their is VERY little opportunity to move up despite what they say. Pay is not great. It shouldnt be so hard to call off days.","2.0

Thu Aug 22 2019 18:17:28 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Crash and Burn,I have been working at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"Good medical insurance, but most employees are <30 years old and don't face real medical issues, so take that with a grain of salt","Well, if you're reading this, you're probably like hundreds of other AEs out there right now - going a little crazy from the micromanagement, blaring music, garbage leads, and incessant roundups. Don't worry, it's not just you. You're not bad at sales - you're probably quite talented. That time you couldn't close the deal with the metal fabricator in Mesa, Arizona? You don't need to ""own your development"" to figure out why you can't hit quota. It was a garbage lead, who has already tried a dying product twice (because past sales reps lied to him about promotions), in an area and industry where paying $450/month to advertise on Yelp will do nothing for him except hurt his wallet. It's not your fault. Yelp's sales model since moving to self-serve ads has been this: load up on recent college grads who have no idea what a professional workplace looks like. Hand them a script. Teach them the script and have them pump out 80 dials/day. Eventually, they'll get some poor ignorant business owner on the phone who isn't familiar with Yelp ads. From there, the manager will ""barge"" the rep and feed them line for line what to say. These lines will be misleading, aggressive, and sometimes flat out lies to get biz owners to give up their credit cards. Some reps will have the stars align - they are kool-aid drinkers who are willing to overlook the fact that the outdated product is a waste of money for 99% of biz owners AND by the grace of god landed a territory with tons of new, ignorant business owners. These are your highest performing reps who will be promoted to sales managers. Not because they are intelligent, have soft skills, or understand how to manage people (they usually have NONE of these qualities) - but because they drink the most kool-aid and truly believe the small business owners are IDIOTS if they arent willing to cough up $500/ month for Yelp Ads. And when teams aren't hitting their numbers, you quickly see how managers (plot twist) actually are not one bit concerned about your development - they really only care about hitting that green number. These sales managers tell reps that they took the managerial role because they want to make reps into better versions of themselves and help them grow as people - but once you have mastered the job there's nowhere to grow. Growth is pretty much lateral - if you move to restaurants, LCP, or another sales division of Yelp, you won't receive a pay raise or bump in title. It's just a slightly different role to keep top producers engaged for a few more months before the burnout. Oh, and now that Yelp execs announced on the August 9 earnings call that they are going to keep salesforce headcount steady as they shift their focus to multilocation and enterprise accounts, get ready to watch opportunities disappear. Headcount has been held ""steady"" in San Francisco since January 2019, and in 8 months the office has decayed from 6 floors full of sales reps to a mere 2 floors as of 9/1/19. It makes sense, though. Now that businesses are aware of self-serve ads and can access them any time, there's no need for reps to call the same businesses and scam them out of cash over and over again. Once you've realized that Yelp's local sales model is pretty broken, and you don't feel good about yourself that you're a part of it, the little things begin to add up. The loud EDM music pumping throughout the office, the 3+ daily ""roundups"" with your 25 year old manager who provides no valuable insight as to how to improve in the job role, the ""incentives"" that are downright insulting. ""Close 2 deals and leave at 3:30 on Friday!"" When you leave Yelp and get a big kid job, you'll see that a ""Summer Friday"" means that lots of people simply leave early on Fridays in the summer, because the company knows that no one is doing anything anyway. You won't have to chip in $20 of your own money to go to a COMPANY SPONSORED EVENT. You'll realize that the level of micromanagement here IS NOT NORMAL. You'll have better incentives to work than breakfast burritos (so insulting). And you'll realize you're more than a vessel for a manager to barge. You deserve better. I could go on and on about things you already know. The review software is sketchy. Reviews DO disappear after advertisers cancel with Yelp. PTO and sick time are not nearly enough.Your office DOES feel like a cult with the constant cheering, clapping, fake-motivational stories, and gong hits.","1.0

Sun Jul 28 2019 22:00:04 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Great Gig Out of College,I worked at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"Work-Life Balance is awesome, you're never expected to work after 5:30PM (unless you want to) Fun Culture, off-sites were truly the best (boating/drinking/dinners) Young, good looking and vibrant people (usually fresh out of college) You will develop a tough skin from getting hung up/cursed out all day Good full-time work experience for someone who may want to pursue something on the side Free (semi-healthy) food/snacks all day. Free Barista. Amazing insurance plan (milk it while you're there) You will develop great phone skills Lots of leave early incentives on Fridays Lots of perks and gifts for closing deals","-Toxic work environment at times, managers will definitely make you feel bad over things you just can't control. -Essentially this job is having you call local business owners (usually in very small towns) and make them stop what they're doing in the middle of the day and get them to a computer to pitch them for around 30-45 minutes and then push them to spend around $300-$450 dollars a month on a product that *most likely* won't even work for them. -When you don't succeed at that, your manager is most likely going to round you up and ask you ""what happened"" and make it seem like this is your fault even though everyone is literally following the same exact script -It is very easy to get screwed over with territories. And everyone is still expected to book 20K regardless of their territories. They tell you that all the regional territories are equal, but they're definitely not. -70% of the managers at Yelp do not have good sales acumen, but rather had great territories as Sales Reps themselves back when business owners still had hope that Yelp ads could work for their business and were able to close a lot of deals. -The demographic of people you will be calling, if you start 2019 and beyond, will be business owners who have already tried the program and canceled it and it will be your job to convince them to resign again. -Very tedious job, cold calling all day can definitely take a toll on your emotional health. I had a doctor once tell me that he sees so many people from Yelp in his office who usually have very high cortisol levels as a result of this job -Very frat/sorority vibe to the office, they do try to be more diverse but it's a little hard to fit in if you're not a conventionally attractive Caucasian person -So many managers are flirting/sleeping with their sales reps, lines of professionalism are usually blurred with management -Music is so loud and so is the gong you hit when you close a deal. It's hard for the business owner to take you seriously with all that noise in the background. It's also difficult to focus as well. -Most people you call really hate Yelp and you will waste a lot of time explaining the review recommendation software which is also really shady. So much of my job felt like being a therapist to business owners who have gotten screwed over by Yelp. You will also feel like tech support much of the time since most of the business owners you talk to don't know how to use a computer. I could go on and on about this job, it's brutal. You will learn life lessons like no other but you will also meet some very great people. A lot of people will probably quit within the first year, but I would recommend this job to anyone who needs the work experience. Getting a job out of college can be tough and having this on my resume has definitely helped me get other jobs after I paid my dues here.","3.0

They actually do hire 100 people every month it’s pretty clear the job is the joke they act like it is. Commission structure is absurd you will have to sell far more than they ever tell you to ever make anything livable. In New York City it’s honestly disgusting what they pay you and doesn’t at all compete with comparable jobs/companies. No bs snacks, swings and happy hours will make up for that! You will truly feel like you are in junior high again. One of the last straws was literally taking time out of the day to go upstairs and play “Indian chief” with another team? What? I’m sure that was “CODA” managers are sleazy and inappropriate and their young age and inexperience contributes to that. tant games, jokes, screaming and yelling which your people on the phone will ask you about. You all go to lunch at exactly 12:00 every day like school children. People literally ride skateboards through the office. If you worked hard for a degree please do something better with it than this. Oh! If you ever decide you don’t want to drink their koolaid anymore and act like a child and not like you are literally working at a real job and decide to give your two weeks. Most managers will instead just tell you to leave that day instead so be ready! I saw it multiple times. Probably because they don’t want you telling the honest truth to HR in an exit interview which you won’t be given if they persuade you not to even finish. Customers will literally tell you over and over to stop contacting them. They will beg you. You will be instructed to keep calling them and from the words of a manager “it’s not your job to decide to call them” “you just have to keep calling them” Your sales territory is most likely awful and you will have to keep it for months on end even after you have exhausted it. I honestly feel disgusted for all the times I was made to hit the gong. I was 37k over quota and 14k over multiple months and was STILL constantly bothered and pressured about doing more.","1.0

Minimum 80 cold calls everyday combined with the constant nagging of managers getting you to hit metrics and why you didn’t get a deal in that day. -by the time I left, I felt as if I was in middle school.

Once you leave, you see how caught up in it people are and don’t realize they’re in a black hole especially with Yelp’s business outlook. -Yelp works to please their investors so they don’t care about us on the forefront of things.

Was astounded by some of the gems they hire.they have Batista bar too and free salad. Good to get a few months of experience and then leave. Stepping stone job. Free snacks. Minimal benefits. When you leave, you will look back at this job and be happy you left. Only giving 2 stars because I wouldn’t have my great job without this experience. When I say they hire anyone I mean anyone.","Unlike all these pompous reviews, I actually sucked at the job. Wasn’t very good. Took me a while to get better. Never made commission due to their shotty structure All in all working at yelp is literally like being a part of the Mafia ran by a bunch of sociopaths. From day one, they tell you that you are not as good as you can be. They spend every second shoving yelp down your thirst because they want you to live eat and breathe the product. The terrible thing is that over time, this product does not work. I did a search in my county (Fairfield county) last week for comic books and received two paid advertisements. One for a mattress store and the other for a music lesson program. How is that at all targeted or a good product? It isn’t. It takes business owners money and that’s all yelp cares about. Yelp needs to restructure its business model and be more business focuses rather than trying to get people to advertise. I left the company because the product didn’t work and I felt like a slimey salesman selling to these people. Not to mention your managers discourage your interacting with clients you signed up. Also my Dog died and after taking a day to recover (which they were annoyed about) I was told to use my emotions as motivation to close deals. I’m sorry but I’m a human being and not a robot. If that doesn’t say everything about this company I don’t know what does. Zero opportunity for advancement. They basically carrot and a stick you into doing sales for a year and promise you all These opportunities that never happen. HR is also a joke. So many managers have sexual relations with their reps. Makes sense as to why one person performs so highly on a team. They make an effort to brush stuff under the rug. They fired a director recently for doing these exact things and played it off that they were voluntarily leaving. They also do a terrible job on boarding You as a new hire. I asked a question regarding their tax form (yelps) and the head of HR had the audacity to say “hire an accountant” I’m sorry but you shouldn’t be head of HR if you cannot help new employees complete tax forms especially when you hire so many fresh grads. They also hire you like 4 months out and will randomly call you before and go “Hey can you actually start tomorrow” yeah real professional. All in all working at Yelp is like mean girls.","2.0

Diversity initiatives are focused on employee driven, grassroots movements but none of the C-Suite champion the importance of diversity or inclusion. Any kind of respect or compassion for neuro-diversity is absent; if you fall on the spectrum of anything perceived as “not normal,” run. There’s no respect or care for people here, or else they wouldn’t be so reactionary and clearly allow favoritism in all of their business units.

The people are actually awesome -- the reason most people stay is because they make friends. Culture is young and fun and very social. Feels like going back to college, in a good way. TBH it's kinda fratty as a whole (welcome to sales), but also diverse enough that you'll find all sorts of people from all over It is really a great job if you are just moving to sf. you'll meet a ton of people and have an instant social network, plus you'll get experience in ""tech"" which is the only game in town atm It's literally a job you don't have to think about after work. You'll never be asked to work overtime. As long as you can leave your crappy day at the door mentally, it's a great job to figure out what you want to do with your life or work on a side project Benefits are great, fully paid kaiser or blue shield, gym reimbursement, 401k match (but the compensation is ridiculously low so it kinda evens out) Before they announced the hiring freeze in sf, it used to be a great company to accelerate your career by moving into sales mgmt. do well here and you could be a mgr in 1 year. that's no longer the case though.","this job is brutal. you are interrupting small business owners in the middle of their day trying to get them to pay money to a company that the majority of them hate. you will get abused multiple times a day and either develop a thick skin or quit. yelp doesn't pay anywhere close to the industry standard. unless you are in the top 1% of the office you're going to be making less than any entry level sdr/bdr at any legit tech company in the bay area. i mean they literally start you at 40k no commission. in san francisco! lmao. the product doesn't really work most of the time. you will see most of the people you sign up cancel within a month or two. then you will get hit with huge commission chargebacks where you end up owing yelp money because your clients cancelled. never mind the fact that we are taught to sell them on the fact that it is super flexible.... yelp ads are no - term contract, no cancellation fee. which means reps do our job and make the sale, then yelp penalizes us because the product doesn't work. there is a complete disconnect between executive level decisions and the realities of the sales org. most of the focus goes into developing new ""products"" instead of making sure the core product (reviews and ads) actually works. the longer you work here the more you realize yelp doesn't care about business owners. it doesn't take very long to realize that yelp doesn't care about their employees either. AE at Yelp is not the same as AE at almost any other tech company. When you do leave you'll realize you are a good candidate for SDR/BDR roles, but most tech companies (and certainly almost all SaaS companies) aren't going to hire you for a closing role. Putting up big numbers at Yelp isn't going to impress them - you're not selling a technical product and its a very transnational, non-complex sales process. You're a good candidate for an sdr/bdr job after 6 months at yelp. If you're going to get that job anyway, there's not much point in sticking around more than a year.","2.0

The people here are great to work with. From the office head to the AE’s. The hiring does a great job in finding some genuine authentic people. A lot of sales jobs have unhealthy competition but the top producer from this office talks to anyone and everyone trying to bring them up with him. Everyone wants success for each other. There is an open door policy of all communication providing a safe and inclusive environment. They strive for diversity and you can see it in all ranges shapes and forms. The training is phenomenal. One of the perks when you interview is you hear about the world class training. This is an understatement. The training provided to AE’s sets them up fully for success. 2 months of training, coaching, and motivating. There is still training throughout being a tenured AE by exceed paths, meetings, and new product releases. It’s just about if that AE wants to actually do them. The LDP program (leadership development program) is about 3 months of great training of how to coach effectively, read kpi’s, handle hr situations, retention through motivation and being close to your team, culture, and CODA (communicate, operate, dress, act when it comes to professionalism) Then the managers go through a role of being in training which is rigorous. The culture is energetic, positive, inclusive, warm and welcoming, and comfortable. Most of my best friends are former and current employees. Pay is good if you make it good it’s a metriocracy. You can fall under quota and not make as much money or consistently be hitting over 30k and make a good living for yourself. It’s all controllable and your manager will help you achieve that if you implement their feedback (most likely they’ve been in your position) Benefits are good and there is a lot of options for families and no complaints at all. PTO provided is the perfect amount. There is access to a full gym, Yelp kitchens stocked with enough food that you can make yourself meals throughout the day and even an on-site amazing staff of baristas. The security is very tight and makes sure everyone wears their badges and multiple layers of security to get into the building. Being a billion dollar tech/sales company they are very careful.","Stressful but what sales job isn’t, just find your outlet.

They make decisions up top and are extremely non-transparent with the rest of the organization. They under pay in almost all parts of the business and overpay on director levels. There is zero onboarding process, it’s up to your manager alone to determine how you will ramp up. By this, i mean most companies will have formal training on what is yelp 101, how does yelp make money, what is the yelp product and what are the companies policies/procedures, or what does the annual reviews look like. NONE of that exists at yelp in any formal way, you will fill out surveys here and there about your experience but it goes into a black hole and nobody talks about it. I’ve also had experiences (along with others) where a manager would tell me i have for example 5% raise and when the letter comes, its 2% simply because the cfo needed to trim dollars somewhere. To add to this, we had hints of a shooter in one of the buildings, a fellow sales rep. despite this, managers encouraged sales reps to continue working disregarding their safety. Cops came to arrest the guy. Culture woman sent out an email to the company addressing what happened that following email, thanks but no thanks, because if the shooter acted any earlier we’d be dead and that evening email doesn’t help.","2.0

Thu Jun 13 2019 09:30:37 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Continuously Improving -- People here are 5-star!,I worked at Yelp full-time for more than 3 years,"I worked at Yelp for over 2.5 years. I started out as an account executive where I struggled. Something that is so great about working here is the culture and investment the managers actually have in your life. If it weren't for my managers and the teams that they grow -- I would've quit because the day to day can be very grueling. I think the daily expectations (what sales leaders expect of you) are true and you need to figure out how to hit them so you can be successful. When I started they truly painted the picture of growing and figuring it out on your own, but sometimes I felt a lot of pressure and fear of having performance conversations. They've done a lot of training in terms of management, because when I started out -- I had some moments were feedback felt on the spot in front of everyone and sometimes people struggle with anxiety. This can cause a huge mental health issue in the workplace and throughout my time - HR started to implement 24/7 therapy. Like I mentioned, continuously growing. I learned so much about myself, sales, and cold calling. It truly is a discipline that everyone should learn BUT the people here are the best you will ever meet! I met people here that I didn't intend on becoming best friends with but even after leaving for other opportunities -- I hope I continue to know these colleagues forever. If you are looking for a challenge, but a place where you will feel supported -- this is a great out of college job. You will learn some amazing communication skills, negotiation, sales, organization, and persuasion techniques. Most of all -- YOU will become successful you just have to listen what management is telling you. The biggest highlight is also how transparent they are in kickoff office-wide meetings. I am constantly impressed with how they are able to get everyone on the same page with such a large number of people across the US. Your team will hold incentives, and managers are taught to break down numbers into attainable portions so that you feel like you can actually hit your number. You will have fun on the phones and probably overcome a lot of fears. If you get an offer here -- take it!","I really only have a few cons: --I wish expectations of how hard the job is at first were really set in the interview (I do think they are working on this, I've seen it drastically improve over the years) --I think they need a therapist in the office or more time to actually have a 10 minute break. Sometimes I felt nervous to get up and go to the bathroom or kitchen for a glass of water because people stare at you, your manager will ask you were you were, and it can feel pressured at times because the role is so fast-paced. This could just be me too, putting pressure on myself. Not everyone may have this issue. --I'm not from the area and sometimes I felt pressured that I couldn't accept phone calls from family (this has been addressed and they were working on more of a work/life balance for employees) --Took them forever to rollout pilots were reps could see what was changing in the company constantly -- now they have updates available all the time --Pay attention to who you are hiring, sometimes people don't have any drive and if you even have a doubt in the interview room don't hire them (this affects team numbers, morale, managers, etc)","4.0

Negative aspects of the job art not explained by management/directors (clawbacks, retention etc.) Nothing is ever good enough, if you close a deal you better close 2 tomorrow. Otherwise you will be receiving a passive aggressive talk from your manager. This is weakly disguises as “wanting the best for you,” when in actuality, it is hoping you close more deals because managers make commission off of your commission.

You meet amazing people with different work ethics and work personalities and it's a great entry level job to get your foot in the door. I know a lot of people write reviews on how intense the environment is and how unorganized it the managers are. But from my personal experience, i had an amazing manager that helped me through my career at yelp. I was definitely a low performing account manager that ranked on the lower half of my class, but my manager was realistic, she set up daily goals and tactics to make sure i got where i needed to be. The training process is long and tiring, but they give you the tools to not only do well in the job, but tools that will carry over in to future careers. There's also complete transparency through out the company. Yeah the pay was not great, but people were paid and promoted based on numbers. Yeah of course there are nicer people who deserve to get promoted, but Yelp solely looked at ones numbers, and in any corporate environment, that's something I learned to grasp.","It is a cold calling job.

You would assume that hiring 30+ per month would mean they are over-hiring in order to weed people out, but there's plans to grow the salesforce to a few hundred more. With a fast growing company comes the natural growing pains, but I've alway felt Yelp has been very transparent on areas of improvements and genuinely care about making changes in attempt to make the day to day and overall job satisfaction better. You can tell they care and that management is doing their best at finding ways to engage their employees, coach them in their careers, and help them feel more connected/inspired. I've always appreciated this. If you fully apply yourself to getting better at your job and working at it every day you will reap the benefits and get promoted gradually. The money is tight at first, but for many it does begin to pay off. I started making comfortable money (subjective, yes) around 8 months on the job. Also, work/life balance is good in my opinion. You are not asked to work late. You have a full hour lunch every day. You are up and out at 5:30pm every day.","It's challenging, particularly early on when you don't know how to handle the tough objections on the phone.

Everyone was very nice and supportive! Management cares about their employees and they make you feel important. You also never have to worry about breakfast or lunch with a fully stocked kitchen.,"Working as an Account Executive for Yelp was the worst job I ever had. Here is why this job is so terrible: 1. 80 - 100 Cold calls per day, it sounds easy but its not. 2. The local businesses are tired of Yelp sales calls and they just don't want to talk. 3. You know the business owner that yelled at you two days ago and told you ever to call back? You'll be calling them in another two days. 4. Be prepared to be micromanaged on almost every call, these managers will make you sell their product to anyone that can breath. 5. The work is extremely unfulfilling and at the end of the day those success stories are a small fraction of the business owners using Yelp. 6. Yelps sales tactics are aggressive and pushy so be prepared to burn really good leads with these sales tactics. 7.

Not even close to what most tech companies will pay for a similar role. Technically commission is uncapped in the sense of how many sales you can close, but the commission is capped at a certain deal size which means i could close someone at $15/day or $30/day and still get the same commission. 2)You're essentially doing an AE job with no SDRs, just cold calling off a list of people who don't want to keep hearing back from Yelp and you're expected to talk them into it. 3) I often had people call me angry about unrecommended reviews or billing, and Yelp is super non-transparent about these processes with their sales staff. I'm not asking for the inner workings of this stuff, but it would help to be able to offer a better explanation to clients rather than just spew the same exact words off the website. 4) While I was really happy with immediate management (most of whom were promoted salespeople), upper management is vague and doesn't tell you much about what's going on with the company- they were talking about closing down the SF sales office while I worked there and it was nebulous and nobody knew what was going on for months.","2.0

This is nothing more than a glorified call center. Don’t let the lovely office fool you. You strictly have 1 daily task and that is to make 80-100 dials to small businesses. 2. The office is filled with high school drama. All managers drink the kool-aid and will try to shove yelps agenda down your throat all day every day. You will know who is sleeping with who and if you don’t hang out and date strictly people from yelp, you barely have a shot in hell of moving up no matter how well you do. 2. The micromanagement is unreal. You will feel like you are in high school and managers are the teachers. They will be on you every time you go to the bathroom or go to fill your water bottle. 4. Yelp ads are a dying product. May businesses have already tried it with no success. But you will be forced to call these people and try to sell the same obselete product over and over again. 5. Sales tactics are bordering on harassment to business owners. You call the same people 3-5 times a week reguardless of if they show interest or not. About 75 of your calls will be hang ups, voicemails or getting yelled at and begged to please stop calling. You will get 5-8”call me backs” that you will probably never hear from again. And 1 yes if you are lucky. 5. This job is mostly luck of who your manager is and what territory you have. They will try to tell you in training that territories don’t matter. But that is flat out not true. If you call a major city you have a chance. But most likely you will start off calling the middle of nowhere. Good luck with that. 6. Google is flat out a better product for small businesses. And buisness owners are learning that at an exponential rate. 7. You are basically lying to small business owners for the sale. Yelp makes promises they can’t deliver. And 90% of the time, a businesses Cpc sky rockets once they sign up for ads. Leaving them with a high bill and no results. 8. Managers will pound into your head that money does not equal reviews. But the majority of businesses that have stopped working with yelp have seen their positive reviews disappear. It’s sketchy","2.0

I respect my manager possibly more than any other person because he’s a stellar human being.,"You call business owners who have been over-prospected, for years. At some point calling with the help mentality just becomes battering a human into paying you money. It’s argumentative and frankly a schit show. One pitch cant possibly work for 25 different industries. A lot of businesses simply aren’t a good fit, but don’t stop pitching or fighting for them to put their credit card in because then “you just don’t want it enough” or “you’re not owning your own development”. Goodness gracious it’s an uphill battle. But hey, if you like arguing and being pushy you will truly thrive. Here’s the thing it’s easy to do the job, it’s extremely hard to make money from it. Commission checks are great if this is your first job out of college, but then you realize that closing 20K and getting around $500 a month is not going to pay the bills. There are so many chaotic moving parts and it’s impossibly hard to consistently close so they make you focus on hyper minuscule behaviors to try and account/measure for not “being successful” there. If I had to do it again I’d probably not work for Yelp, but since I am an extremely positive person I have to say I did learn a lot. Like how this job is unsustainable and they give you lots of bro culture and free food with blaring music to distract you. They all know the job sucks and people quit ASAP so they honestly try to make people stay but once you’re out they totally turn on you.But hey if another killer company recruits you because they see yelp on your resume and they know you’re taught to sell until the other person hates you, then I’m grateful to say yes and get out and give a real sales position a go. I mean just look at how many people are in their hiring classes, they are fully prepared to lose hoards of people any given day. PS the top 5% really do kill it here, because there’s plenty of sketchy things that happen under the radar to help them get there. It’s whack. But hey take away good friendships because that’s the only reason I lasted so long here.","2.0

Seriously, calling the same accounts over and over, only giving them a 2 day between our harassing phone calls. I can deal with cold calling if I actually believed in what I was selling but I didn't around month 3. A lot of these businesses have been calling since about 2011 - 12 and either will not answer the phone or curse you out if they do. There is constant micromanaging - ""didn't pitch? Email me why didn't and what went wrong?"" Too many roundups with the SAME EXACT INFORMATION EACH TIME, gets tiresome. Energy on the pod seems low? Lets all just clap obnoxiously or stand up while we make dials - laughable, it's like we're children. If you're not performing well some days you get degrading emails from you manager or floor director. There's crappy incentives to attempt to motivate folks to crank out dials. It's a toxic, competitive environment that plays favorites because high producing reps get better territory opportunities. Low base pay and commission not entirely worth it unless you move departments or get promoted. Last bit here - I've witnessed managers making reps cry at their desk if they weren't performing, is that your culture, Yelp? Making grown adults cry at their desk due to pressure and degradation from higher ups? I'm over this place, over the cold calling, harassing business owners and getting harassed by higher ups if I'm not doing well some days. If you really want to make it here, turn off your brain and any moral compass you have if you want to make sales here.","2.0

Thu May 16 2019 11:21:21 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Executive,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Fun people, nightmare of a job.",I worked at Yelp full-time for less than a year,The upbeat environment and people that you meet. The kitchen is decent but it gets old quick much like everything else with this job. The in house coffee bar is the best part. happy hours to drink away your sorrows. You will gain some experience in sales if you've never had any and you'll learn how to overcome objections(you'll be faced with a ton),"Turn over is high. Don't be surprised if a lot of the people you meet in training are not there in a few months. The job is high stress and low reward and the supposed world class training is actually very basic. Being forced to stand and make dials is common place to ""build energy"" and majority of the incentives are childish and the constant group round ups always have the same tired message. Don't expect getting coaching worthwhile other than your manager feeding you lines. They'll tell you pipelines don't matter...but they do. Talking or trying to talk to business owners who either have zero interest, need or are just exhausted from the amount of sales calls they get.","2.0

It is really bothersome to know that a manager who has been reported to HR multiple times for verbal abuse and for sleeping with reps, is still employed. HR claims to take everything very seriously but it seems like they brush off every major problem and really only tackle the minuscule ones, like a rep being late to their post as they show up for their shift at the call center.","1.0

Thu May 16 2019 07:12:00 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Account Exevutive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,"Toxic, manipulative, and overall negative experience",I worked at Yelp full-time for more than a year,"Yelp has amazing health insurance, transit, and wellness benefits. Great place to make friends if you're new to the city. The basic sales training you receive will set you up for success at your next opportunity. The restaurants segment of the company is real cool. I still use the app daily. Some other less serious pros: If anyone from MTV/VH1/E! is reading this - pick this up for your next reality show idea. Yelp NYC would also make an EXCELLENT focus for a college level psychology course study.","I’ll start with the obvious red flags. First, the company is no longer growing, there are performance based layoffs, and they’re even “relocating” San Fransisco sales (AKA dissolving). Hiring is halted in Phoenix and Chicago as well. Aside from the new DC office and the ever growing NYC office, increasing headcount is not a priority for Yelp anymore. That is a fact that was stated in a monthly kickoff meeting. Next, Yelp isn’t retaining advertising clients and investors are worried. The new no term contract model that was implemented fully about a year ago is a massive #fail and Yelp retained 0 net clients. Check it. That was published. The stock prices have flatlined/dropped and a big change has to be coming. Some people speculate a possible sale. Since there are no terms on the advertising we sell, clients have the ability to turn off their ads as they please. Reps are initially compensated on the hope that the average client stays advertising for 3 months. If the client turns off their ads before then, the rep is punished in the next commission cycle. Managers are in such a transaction/dialing mindset that they’re not teaching their teams how to maintain client relationships after the sale. Reps aren’t making money anymore because of this. Lastly, there have been 3 directors, several senior managers, and hundreds of reps leave the NYC office in the past 12 months. Yelp is resorting to hiring managers from outside companies because pickings are so slim and have been detrimental to retention internally. Perspective employees: please beware of joining a company where growth is at a standstill and opportunities are becoming more limited on the inside. Since the company is strapped to find quality leadership candidates they resort to hiring inexperienced, immature, and unintelligent reps internally to take on teams of 10-14 reps. They’ve created a “system” (Leadership Development Program) as an attempt to remedy the situation, but this is just where the micromanaging begins. Team culture is taught to be toxic and managers are trained to invade your life in the most unhealthy ways. Teams have group chats in and outside of the office, so you can never escape the daily anxiety when you’re trying to relax at home after work. There are multiple reports of directors and managers sleeping with reps. Some managers will aggressively micromanage you with screenshots of metrics, pings, and constant reminders that other people are working harder, and “where are you???” texts at 8:31AM. If you do decide to give Yelp 2 weeks notice, some managers will ask you to leave right on the spot. Yelp promotes a very specific type of person into their exclusive leadership squad, and the majority of those people lack emotional intelligence, empathy, and basic social skills. I was told “no” more times than I was told “yes” at Yelp. In reality what they’re looking for are leaders that they can easily brainwash into creating more little dialing machines. If you’re a genuine thinker and challenge the norm here, look at other companies that have more options for upward growth where you can actually contribute to building something. Here are some examples of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior I’ve experienced at Yelp as a direct result of the reps that they are choosing to reward with leadership positions: I’ve seen a rep sleep with one of their clients, complain on a daily basis, have the lowest metrics on the team, and then GET PROMOTED INTO MANAGEMENT!!!! I’ve also had a manager separate our team into extremely obvious “A” and “B” squads to the point where they would round up reps that weren’t producing separately from reps that were doing well. The purposeful separation was obvious and manipulative AF. I’ve heard managers audibly complain in the kitchen about resignations and how lazy their reps are. Managers only hang out with each other getting drunk at bars with their reps every single night. If reps are on the verge of quitting, less experienced managers will tell them they they're not trying hard enough. Come to find just a simple manager switch to someone more senior makes those same reps produce 40K+. Leadership will use encourage social media use so you can see them going on lavish vacations. You’ll think to yourself, “One day that will be me!!!! Just 6 more months until I’m promoted!” They WANT you to see how successful they are so you stay longer to make THEM more money. But don’t be fooled. That won’t be you, and that opportunity won’t come. One time a VP came to do a “fireside chat” and told a cute story about keeping a positive mentality. Her story involved her being pregnant while her house was being renovated. When she gave birth her house still wasn’t finished and she had to couch surf in all of her rich friend’s houses and got sick of it. So then she just “jetted off to Mexico for a month and made the best of it!!!!!” Must be nice, so glad I can definitely do that with my $50,000 base salary you silly and immature WENCH. And finally, whatever form of fake support you feel from your managers/directors when you’re working with them will immediately disappear as soon as you leave the Yelp nest. I was unfollowed by some people at Yelp on social media quicker than you can say “pull out your phone and go to yelp.com.” Thanks for ""totally being there if you ever need me."" :) This is the kind of example senior leaders at the company are setting. Another unhealthy component at Yelp is the gossip culture. Upper management is doing very little to help the situation by not addressing the obvious manager AND rep retention problem. Personnel changes are kept secret until the very last day of the month and you’re told to just deal with the “change is a good thing and happens every 30 days at this psychotic institution!” mantra. The change is so often here with managers quitting, getting demoted, etc that some reps go through as many as 5-6 managers A YEAR. As you can imagine, this is less than ideal when trying to develop professionally and perfect your craft. From what I experienced on the inside; The CULTure that Yelp breeds is unhealthy and unprofessional, and just plain distracting. Group think is extremely powerful especially when dealing with hundreds of Type A/borderline ADHD millennials that are fresh out of college life. Everything about the culture is built to entice and manipulate employees to stay past their limit when in reality this job isn’t designed for anything past a 1.5-2 year career path. Yelp hires people who will become your best friends, and THAT’S ALL PART OF THEIR PLAN. Everything about the culture they have built makes Yelp a breeding ground for weight gain, anxiety, depression, lack of motivation, and the stifling of creativity. Worst of all, the repetitive nature of the position will cause you to lose braincells. Sure, I can manage a pipeline like a pro and rip open calls like nobody’s business, but the amount there is to learn out there in the real advertising and sales world is astronomical compared to what you’re taught at Yelp. Title changes and “promotions” like 5-9 and franchise are literally made up and require no more skill than local. It’s all the same. You will not learn how to properly prospect and maintain client relationships at Yelp. And be prepared for that to be brought up when you’re interviewing. Go elsewhere and learn how to be a real salesperson.","2.0
