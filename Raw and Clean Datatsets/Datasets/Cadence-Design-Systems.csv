The CEO is clearly clueless about the technologies developed in the company, so obviously isn't suitable to making those decisions and must rely on subordinates. The lower management level is a combination of some knowledgeable people and some total ignoramuses and everything in between. That environment is quite poisonous for technically minded people because they have to contend with the Darwinian survival of fittest, when the fittest are those scheming quite illiterate people carving their career niches. No wonder, the company is spying on their employees, installing the stealthy monitoring software on the laptops. The company constantly hiring H1B, novices, moving business oversees, and pushing experienced employees out. So the development base is getting cheaper and less capable, while the management increases their salaries. The company got rid of vacation time, calling it ""unlimited vaction."" In reality it means your time off is still recorded but you don't accrue any vacation pay. This gives the managers even more freedom to play favorites, which is already pretty rampant. And there is something else appeared in recent years, that wasn't there before. There is now a push to spread socialist ideas in the work place. Women of Cadence are slowly by steadily trying to introduce those ideas in various forms.","2.0

The work is challenging and the career plane is good, specially if you like the hardware verification area. You can be in touch with the costumers, that are all big and known companies.","The majority of Cadence employees are men over 50 years old. Most of the benefits are for people this age, i.e they constantly have speakers coming to the campus to talk about ""how to choose a good college for your children"". The maternity paid leave is only 55 days, and the paternity leave is only 5 (five!) days. They don't promote too many events to make people get to know each other, so young professionals usually feel lonely on the work routine. The environment is very serious and nobody talks to each other, specially because the cubicles have tall walls around them. If you want to eat a snack, the only option you have are nuts and coffe/tea. You have to buy your own snack and lunch, and the food on the cafeteria is not even good. The wages for recent grads are usually lower then the average on Bay Area.","3.0

Tue Aug 25 2015 06:12:07 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Former Employee ,Strong engineering company with no marketing,I worked at Cadence Design Systems full-time for more than a year,Cadence is a remarkably strong engineering company in the EDA business. This is a shrinking business in terms of the number of companies designing ICs. The industry is currently consolidating. So EDA companies must sell more to fewer customers to grow. Cadence is getting very good at developing/finding more to sell.,"A few strong leaders control the company's direction to the detriment of the rest of the company. The focus is on IC tools because they sell for higher dollars, which leaves the other tools like the pc board tools to languish. This focus also dictates the selling style, which emphasizes the personal relationships between upper management and a few customers rather than making use of marketing to reach a much broader audience. It's possible to do both. Cadence does not.","4.0

Vacations/Shutdowns are strictly enforced during specific times of the year, and new employees were required to borrow against future years. Design/development process is rigid, non-agile and counter productive. Layers of specification approvals were required before any work or prototyping could begin. As a developer, the spec reviews were over attended, sometimes contentious and provided little assurance that you would be developing what was actually required since the attendees almost never came prepared (well, in the 6 years I was there I never had one where everyone who ""just had to attend"" was prepared).","2.0

On-site cafeteria is good, and the gym access was also a very nice plus. Scale of IT systems operations (nodes, geographic distribution, size of individual systems, complexity of the farm as a whole) is pretty cool from a challenge perspective.","I left during a general RIF which also saw termination of most of the executive suite. At upper levels of management, corporate direction was wanting and the company's position relative to competitors was slightly unfavorable on the market. There's a solid base of customers, but growth is limited (there's also a limited amount of growth within the EDA market as a whole). There's also a 20+ year tech legacy, which makes systems somewhat less than cutting edge, and the company lags in adopting new (especially Open Source) technology. At the time the company shed much long-lived talent as well, to its detriment.","4.0
