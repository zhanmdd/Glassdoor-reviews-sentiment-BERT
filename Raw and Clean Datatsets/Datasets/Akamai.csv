Thu Jan 30 2020 02:08:13 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Asia, TN",Former Employee ,I enjoyed this company but I don't recommend.,I worked at Akamai full-time for more than 3 years,"It's very difficult to divide  and Cons. I'll try to write actual situations I encountered, not just writing my impressions, ""good or bad"". So let me mix them up here. As a memorial to my leave this company. (Place and title is anonymous) == Culture == I had worked for a bureaucratic company that everyone including non-tech people would know the name and is several ten times larger than Akamai. From my experience, Akamai has five times more managers and positions compared to a far larger company than Akamai. I feel too many management teams and the job titles end up leading Akamai to ""no decision can't be made"". Even though Akamai is still small - midsize company, Akamai is the most bureaucratic company I've ever experienced. The interesting part is that there are so many rules but many managers even don't care about the rules. They tend to overwrite even very basic company rules. In most cases, those rules are used to say ""It's not my/our job"". A lot of red tapes in Akamai. So, it's sometimes impossible to achieve a very simple thing. Let's say, when you go to someone to ask a task following a guide on the intranet, you might be told ""it's not my task because my manager has told me it's not our task even if they're defined and written on the intranet"". Or ""I know Akamai is selling that service/product but our team doesn’t have enough skill, so we don’t do that."" These are just examples, but you would often encounter similar situations because one small task is divided into many small tasks. It's very common throughout the company, not depending on your job title. So, in most cases, I think your responsibility is very small compared to average companies. If you like small tasks and don’t want to experience new things. I recommend this company. You would get a great work-life balance. But if you are like go-to-guy, I don’t recommend this company because a lot of people would come to you and push you to do their jobs even if those tasks are not your responsibility. No rules. You need to work with many people to achieve a small task. Sometimes, you need to find someone who follows the company rules secretly behind his/her managers if the manager is kind of people who don't like to follow the rules. The more you are versatile, the more you would encounter these troublesome situations. I felt Akamai consists of village culture. Cliques are everywhere. They control the company and block innovation and changes. And the culture created by them is, as you can imagine, naturally corrupting. If you like corruption and are good at getting benefits from the culture, this culture will fit you. I think this creates village culture. I've seen several bullies consistently over the years. One bully is recognized and reported even by a customer. So, I could say it's the prevailing culture. HR recognizes those bullies but seems trying to confine them as if there is nothing happening. And I've seen some managers seem to have difficulties communicating with customers or partners. I've seen and been told by customers or partners that some of Akamai's managers are arrogant even in front of customers even when they have trouble with their platform. Naturally, many staff employees follow that kind of style while saying customers are most important. So, you often encounter many illogical situations. One best point in Akamai would be that you can get more anger management ability. I was told by my former colleagues in Akamai. ""You proved yourself to be a really bad guy because you could work for such a long time in Akamai"" Many good colleagues quit. The average is around one or two years. They are still good friends.","Instead of . I put my review from the perspective of technologies. == Technologies == I don’t recommend this company, especially for engineers. If you want to have some experience with CDN, go to Fastly or AWS. Akamai CDN is based on old physical server technologies, there a lot of legacy operations that seem to be automated very easily. Akamai is trying to move on to new technologies, but it's too slow. The number of CDN servers is still number one in the world and the strongest point from the perspective of capacity. But Akamai started losing the advantage as other cloud vendors are focusing on CDN. And I feel making things more complicated by dividing into many manual tasks is the typical Akamai way while many tech companies making things easier with technologies. There are many small products based on CDN which could be a simple product with other venders. I would say they are coming from too many organizations and politics. The way I look at it, to create more positions, Akamai has needed to divide one product into many products. Maybe there is so much to do. But that would be because of a lot of manual work which comes from the immaturity of legacy product architectures and approval processes which have to go through many people. It's very common for engineers to say that they feel they are wasting their time, should be able to consolidate these tasks. For example, with AWS, you may be able to do a task in 5 minutes. With Akamai, it takes one month or impossible. If it's a simple task, these things could happen very easily. And roles are divided into many job titles. So, your responsibility would be very small. Depending on your situation, most of the tasks you do could be clerical tasks. At least I know a few guys who weren't satisfied with their roles and quit saying that their responsibility is too small and they can't understand why a simple single task requires many people. So, if you have good work ethics to learn more and work hard, I think this is not the place you should belong to. You would encounter a lot of red tapes and politics, local rules by cliques. For example, in other companies, one person can manage and complete one simple task. But in Akamai, sometimes it can be called a project and may require three or four people. But you can’t tell these things from job description open on the internet. Akamai is trying to expand into new technology areas such as enterprise security which are completely different from CDN. But Akamai has track records keep failing new business. You can find them if you look up on the internet carefully. As I see it, Akamai tries to put those new businesses into the same business framework as CDN. So, Akamai still has difficulties to get those new business rolling. So, you shouldn’t expect much in these areas. Some people may like birth pains to create new things and get new business rolling. But I think only you can encounter there would be politics and red tapes, a lot of reasons ""we don’t do that"" by old cliques who stick to the experience of CDN. I've seen a few people left in very short terms, again and again, saying that they had trouble with those situations. It seems a typical innovation dilemma. If you have good experience in those areas, it wouldn't work here. Even with CDN business, Akamai doesn’t allow customers to sign up online. You need to sign a contract that is really complicated and hard to understand and takes a lot of time. From outside, as many cloud companies allow customers to sing up online, it seems an easy thing. But Akamai has a lot of reasons why ""we don't / can't do that"". There are a lot of people involved in one product development, but even the specifications of a product are very vague. Most of the specifications are ""not defined"". So, learning a product takes a lot of effort and time then even with that effort and time, you will still be not sure about the product. Actually, there are many materials online, but most of them are sales/marketing materials even though they are supposed to be targeted at technical people. In most cases, you need to work based on some kind of rumors. Product information is usually exchanged verbally or through chatting. In most cases, the source of information is someone's blog on the intranet. No culture to write down information. Everyone is not sure who is responsible for a product even though there are many product managers. Product managers (I don’t know why there are many product manager titles for one product) are in most cases not able to be responsible for their products probably because of a lot of red tapes.","2.0

Akamai became extremely lazy in the hiring process over the last half decade. Rather than finding good cultural fits, they just started hiring the first candidate that met a desired quota. Real Estate leadership team was an example of nepotism at it finest. It’s run by a crew of inexperienced career climbers with undefined, but well compensated roles, and a “do as I say, not as I do.” attitude. Hint—when you tell other departments that their space utilization is an issue, but most of your Directors and VP work from home or their real estate brokers office 3-4 days a week, it’s not a good look. HR leadership is a lacking. They generally couldn’t be bothered to weed out harassment or bullying even when it was staring them right in the face. Victim blaming and excuse making became all too common. Suggestion: Stop ignoring the patterns of misbehavior and hope it will go away when mistreated employees get fed up and leave. Acknowledging, but failing to correct or remove the problem actors doesn’t solve anything. It just reinforces that the misbehavior is acceptable to a company that represents itself as an inclusive “Great Place to Work”.","2.0

The problem is, if you are good at what you do but, you are surrounded by unqualified people in the wrong roles, you are inevitably going to disagree with them. That doesn't fly with the egos in this marketing leadership team. They are only interested in ""Yes Men."" You can almost surely expect to be on the next round of layoffs if you don't get with their ill-conceived program. A lot of talented people have gone out the door for no good reason. Did I mention the layoffs? They happen annually as well as random points throughout the year. Job security is non-existent in the marketing department. There is no actual plan in any of the day-to-day work, no overarching strategy in the marketing, and no analytics being used improve the effectiveness of the work. Even though the tools are readily available, it takes competent leadership get the department to properly put them to use. There's little to no cooperation between teams and zero accountability when things get really screwed up (and they do get screwed up often. Projects take so much longer than they ever should.

If you joined during the early days and part of the old boy network, you will be secure and protected. If you're part of any new hire in last few years, be prepared to be let go in a heart beat, nobody will back you up from the management team as they will only be worried about their own jobs. The sales teams are shocking to work with, they are mostly fly-boys, complain about Akamai all the time and how they could earn more money elsewhere and brag about their Porsches and R8s all the time, no commitment to the company. I met many sales people who were in Akamai, left, rejoined and wanted to leave again which Akami embrace as they're only interested in the dollar. The experience of the management team is very poor and they wouldn't stand a chance in any other business I have worked in. They are used to hiding in their offices, taking no ownership or responsibility. The current CEO has no balls since Elliott Management took a hefty stake in the business. Elliott now runs Akamai and the CEO and his inexperienced management team dance to the beat of the Elliott drum. The company is being shaped by Elliott for imminent acquisition so if you're reading this and thinking of joining then I would advise waiting as you might not be in your job long; sleep easy though as the CEO and his inexperienced management team will make a lot of money out of this. Finally, the HR team are useless, have no power, no control, another bunch of inexperienced individuals given power but can't help you, only help themselves.","1.0

From organizational maturity, to analytic and clear strategy, to the professionalism of the people here… I love almost everything about Akamai.","It’s a well-known fact that you don’t mention your political alliances and opinions in the workplace because it’s divisive. Then why do some Akamai leaders think that it’s ok to mention their support for the U.S. military and express their “patriotism” in front of a diverse audience? I understand that September 11, 2001 was huge for Akamai. It’s understandable that the story of “The U.S. rises strong after the terrorist attack” got intertwined with Akamai’s story back then, BUT IT IS 2018 and a lot has happened since. Also, Akamai is a global company now. Those at Akamai who are supportive of the U.S. government and military need to stop using and building upon that narrative that came out of September 11. All employees at Akamai should be able to rally behind its leadership and strive hard to make Akamai win. This kind of talk by the Akamai leadership is not conducive to that. It’s not conducive to having an inclusive workplace in 2018. That reactionary and war-mongering narrative is better kept for executive round-tables or when dealing with customers in the military industrial complex. I am sure it helps build credibility in front of that kind of crowd.","4.0

This includes whether any on-call work is compensated at all, and how much on-call work is required to keep your job. If you get onto a bad team, there is no upper limit on how many nights, weekends, and holidays you could spend putting out fires. - Some departments, like Platform Operations, mostly contain bad managers who literally laugh in the faces of employees expressing distress, in front of many other employees. - Akamai does the minimum for transgender people that they are legally required to do. When I was there, their ""LGBT"" ERG was almost entirely cisgender gay men handing out Human Rights Campaign flyers and patting themselves on the back. The company had no gender-neutral restrooms anywhere in the world, and the LGBT ERG was reluctant to say or do anything about that. If you want an LGBT ERG to do anything but celebrate marriage equality and give you ice cream, try another company. - Their approach to disability is also ""we will obey the law, and do absolutely nothing else."" To the best of my knowledge, there is no disability ERG, many accommodation requests are denied, requests that are accepted take weeks or months, and nobody whose request is denied sticks around for more than a few months. - Their approach to infrastructure/operations is seriously flawed and outdated. When I was there, I felt like Akamai was worse than average, but after leaving and getting context from people at other companies, I feel like their NOCC offices are best described as sadomasochistic performance art.","2.0

Not uncommon for offices (excluding Cambridge) to be completely empty on a regular basis. Interpret from that what you will. Initial offer was decent. Yearly raise was absolutely pathetic. Stock options are a nice gesture, but are too volatile to be considered anything but a token offering. Go look at the stock price right now. Then look at it over the last 5 years. There are a lot of smart, well-rounded people here.","Ridiculously long and drawn out training process. Bulk of what is taught here is to bring someone who knows nothing of CDN into being able to have a conversation (possibly in a vacuum.) In other words, training is a ""one size fits all"" approach, and most of what is heavily emphasized will never be used in a setting with a client. Regular, mandatory meetings that bring nothing of substance forthe employees, and is more in-person information gathering for middle management. The travel costs for organizing across the entire company must be astronomical. Regular, mandatory calls (think 5-10 employees) for trivial matters. Regular, mandatory training for new products, and yearly refreshers to ensure you haven't forgotten what you already knew. This is heavily rooted in the ""MIT Culture"", which if it works for you, great. Most of what I've learned never happened in a classroom. Advancement is generally given to those who have lingered long enough without quitting or being fired. Sales rules this company. Full stop. Even the most oblivious in the ranks here have a lot of political power, and you either go with that flow or you get thrown overboard. This place belongs to the old guard, and they will defend their place at all costs. There are not enough smart, well-rounded people here.","2.0

Has some decent technology. Has been around for years. Makes good acquisitions to stay relevant!,"For a technology company, there's a huge shortage of good engineers, with knowledge of new frameworks. Everything gets built on top of old code that's clunky and difficult to QA. Many releases have to get rolled back because they cause customer issues or simply don't work! It takes a painfully long time to get new features out, many times years... and by the time something is released, there are multiple competitors doing the same thing much better and for lower price! Finally, certain teams/industries get all the attention of product and engineering and everything gets built with them in mind. The rest of the customer base is left with having to shoehorn Akamai products into their workflow. As a company, there's a huge middle management layer that's ineffective and adds to employee frustration. These are managers who play politics, don't care about helping their direct reports advance their careers, and are simply dead weight. This adds to the work/life imbalance for high throughput employees and lets those doing bare minimum fly under the radar (and many times, get promoted!).","3.0

I was completely burned out within a couple of months. I seriously felt like I went back in time on this job....I had to fill out a daily call log with at least 30 calls a day, an updated pipeline chart twice a week, and another chart that listed every meeting I had with detailed notes updated daily. My manager wanted to be on every single call I made. This was a car salesmen environment where I was forced to ram deals down a customers throat knowing they would probably never take another call from me again in the future. Work/life balance consisted of my manager calling/texting/emailing all day, and even after hours for the same things we previously discussed 10 times during work hours. I used to have dreams about my phone going off with a text saying ""fire drill everyone needs to get on a conference call right now!"" We would all hop on and he would say we need to hop into SFDC to ""commit"" deals that had zero chance of closing. He wanted to inflate his numbers while making us all look like clueless morons when these deals went no where. Out of the 10+ people that started on his team, there is currently ONE left. ONE. Maybe chalk this up to a terrible manager? I reported him more than once. Akamai offers a 6 month draw because you are not expected to sell much until then. I wasn't even given my account list until month 3. However I was put on PIP in month 4. I sold my first deal in month 5. I was fired in month 6. Best day of my career was walking out that door.

He gave me an excellent recommendation that still helps me today. Then I moved to a different team. The woman who I reported to was a manager from hell. I just graduated from grad school and I needed working visa sponsorship, so I tried my best to cope. I worked really hard and tried to do a good job, but everyday I was just depressed. There is no guidance, no training, no explanation on what we're doing. I was used like a data-pulling machine. No context of why doing this, how to do it. If i did it slow, she would pour on me ""then what's the differece between you and some cheap guy in India?"" When i ask a question, I would get a condescending push-back ""I dont understand what you're saying"" and then she just turned around. When I said someone else did this before, let me go ask him. She said ""NO,then he has all the CREDIT."" When someone feels her result is fishy and wants to take a look at the raw data, and I said ""Sure, I'll send"", she would scold me so bad because she wanted to protect her own work. ...... Simply put, there was no respect and I was bullied. After a while, I tried to talk to the good old HR ""business partner"" (native me). The HR person didnt help. She just turned around and told my manager even though i said the chat was ""confidential"". You can imagine how i was treated after that. I learned from the bad manager what to avoid when one day I manage people.

They all seem to be similar in style: first priority is their job security and career ladder, last thing on their mind is their employees and company long term health and development. All these kinds of management culture even made engineers working in the similar selfish style. in the end, team work, enthusiasm, innovation and collaboration cross departments are getting less and less over the years. Company will suffer in the end. Job pay level including bonus and stock is on the cheap side, i.e. low end of Silicon Valley range. Besides, company gears up more to hire H1 visa cheap labor, to relieve its non-competitiveness in retaining good employees. Some HR managers are not fair to employees either. They work from headquarters in Boston. Know very little about Silicon Valley open culture and employee concerns. When employee reports issues about their managers to HR, they feel like colluding with the manager to defeat the employee, rather than addressing employees concern and solving problems of the bad manager and management culture. All these culture things make me think never recommend someone to work for a company headquartered in East coast.","1.0

They say they want people to challenge the norm but many managers are threatened by that policy. Not well liked by customers as their reputations is one of arrogance.

There is a lot of tech debt including applications with poor documentation and without unit tests. Career advancement for software engineers is hard to predict or understand.

The company is particularly well managed, treats employees well, and compensates people at an above average level. The overall benefits package is very good. Management is very transparent (this is a public company) in does quarterly meetings telling us how the business is doing. Excellent work/life balance.","There aren't many downsides to working at Akamai. There is the general challenge of working in Cambridge which can be expensive to commute to and live in. The company does not provide things like free parking or gyms, etc. Currently the company is in multiple sites in Cambridge having outgrown its resources. It is expected to relocate (probably in Cambridge or Boston) in 2017. As to your particular job and the career track that depends almost entirely on your managers. The company does promote somewhat from within, but doesn't make it an emphasis. Over the past 4 years the company has nearly tripled in size from 1800 to 6000, and the quality of the people has diminished. People there tend to be happy and have voted the company the 3rd best large company to work for in Massachusetts.

The CEO truly cares about making the company great and makes himself very visible and has very good demeanor. Benefits are outstanding. People who have worked there long try to make it great as well.

People are dauntingly smart, friendly, and helpful, the work is challenging but interesting, the benefits are very good, and the pace - while certainly subject to the occasional flurry of long hours - is remarkably life- and family-friendly. I'm sure that some of this has to do with the ability to work remotely as needed, and I imagine all of this is variable by the team, but I've met mostly really happy and satisfied people here. While there are politics and tsuris everywhere, I've seen far less of what feels like some of the ugly back-stabbing and political maneuvering here than at many places I've worked. Senior management seems as open and communicative as anywhere I've ever been, and Tom Leighton is a wonderful face and voice of leadership for the organization (with some pretty stylin' dance moves, too). Most importantly - and I can only say this about my own team and manager, but I gather that it is true in many parts of the company - I feel supported in all of my efforts; that my manager is interested not only in getting the best work out of her team, but that we are happy, satisfied in our work, not overburdened, and with a clear direction in which to head to keep our careers moving forward.","This is a very complex and highly technical space to be in, and if you come in with no domain knowledge, there will be some serious ramp up and learning you need to do. Fortunately, the company is great about training and giving you the room and resources to bring yourself up to speed. One challenge is that, while there are many, many resources for improving your understanding of the space and the Akamai ecosystem, FINDING those resources can be tricky, and sometimes what you find is out of date. Getting accurate information from the right people can sometimes be a challenge. Also, while the company is very committed to UX, getting access to actual customers on a UX basis is not something ingrained in the fabric here yet, and it can be tricky. There is also not yet a good communication structure between UX teams, so there is a lot of overlap, unanswered questions, and asking forgiveness rather than permission. Finally, if you start after a certain point in the year, you end up being not eligible for a bonus when the time rolls around (I started a week after that cutoff, it turned out). It would be far better if they prorated the bonus structure for the part of the year in which you were with the company, rather than just cut you loose. It would at least have been nice to have been told this during recruitment to set my expectations properly, since bonuses were touted as a pretty big part of the benefit structure.","5.0

Some of the best minds in IT work here and are driven to a common goal of making the Internet faster, more reliable, and scalable. Benefits package is very good: unlimited time off, paid maternity/paternity, 1/2 of 8% 401k matching, etc. Fun working environment with the primary driving factor being to work hard but have fun.","Company culture dictates that you're ""always on"", which has an impact on work/life balance. The general expectation is that you will be available if needed for a customer, regardless of holiday / weekend / time off. Extremely risk adverse company (with regards to employee terminations) meaning that some employees are not performing and yet remain with company. As it continues to grow this becomes more of a challenge as the company is losing it's ""Akamai DNA"" and the new hires don't have that same drive.","4.0
