Fri Jan 24 2020 10:51:02 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Contract Specialist,"Cincinnati, OH",Current Employee ,USA Today ranked cdk 16th worst employer in the US for a reason.,I have been working at CDK Global full-time for more than 3 years,The handful of people who are not inept are the only saving grace of this place.,"Very few people at this company have any clue what their job even entails. They basically laid off half the company in 2016 through 2018 for all the old employees making money (the ones who knew how things worked) and literally had NO operating procedures or training prepared so it basically became a complete free for all of ever competing opinions. Redoing work because of lack of procedures is so common you may waste an entire day doing what should have taken an hour if the expectations and directions were clear. Managers performance punish across the board. Ive only ever had to put in one HR complaint in my entire life and it was at cdk, i normally cant stand the 'kind of people' who file complaints but this was warranted. When I did I was written up for an ""outburst"" to my manager when I told her she was harboring a hostile work place by letting sales people lie to management about what internal employees had said and done (never been written up in 20 years of employment anywhere and am usually promoted at every job) this is of course a known problem but talking about it is strictly forbidden. The idea of an open door policy is a joke, HR eill dragtheir feet to protecttheir managers for weeks if you do speak up. After I promised to file a complaint with the ohio eeoc they took retribution via write up which requires staying in your department as punishment on me even though a vp of hr already said it would be a good idea to resolve my situation by us finding a new place for me, then the HR person eho allowedthat , who was friends with my boss, didnt even know ""about those conversations"" despite me tellingher aboutthem in email. Lol. Now I found a new job and put in my two weeks and despite assurance by HR that my funds would still be direct deposited theyve neglected to pay me...this is the MOST disorganized company in the world. Almost everone I know who worked here has payroll issues when they leave. And thats not hyperbole, I mean almost EVERYBODY. This place is allegedly a technology company yet cant sustain their internal systems which break down daily, often because they accidently fired a developer and.didnthavethe technical specs recorded anywhere, causing delays that are then the workers fault because the management, an ever rotating cast of VPs changing responsibilities who all are horrible at their jobs, wont prioritize fixing anything in lieu of some ""new systems"" that are always promised but never delivered. Theres a reason this place was the 16th worst place to work accorsing to USA Today in 2017. Trust me...run.","1.0

Many of my closest friends I met through ADP Dealer Service (now CDK Global). ADP had its normal work challenges but it was functional and people were overall kind. It was a team effort that focused on the client.,Once ADP spun off the company and it became CDK it was nothing but turmoil. People were in constant fear of losing jobs and there was a complete changeover of personnel from executives to local managers/supervisors. The new leaders coming in are so sure that they are smarter than everyone else but many leave not accomplishing much. CDK became all about the stock price. The employee and clients no longer mattered. People that do well are yes people not questioning anything even if it is to the detriment to the employees or clients. That was not me so I quit.,"2.0

Critical brain drain with knowledgeable people laid off or having quit in desperation. They’ve cut way past the bone. Typing pool seating is a nightmare for introverts.

Everything is just too much: too much “doing more with less,” too much stress, too much talk from ELT where they don’t walk the walk, too much pretending to be something they’re not—a company that cares about its employees, or a company with integrity. My beef is mainly with upper management. They sunk so low that they have a long way to go to earn back any trust. Hasn’t happened yet.

The view from the office is amazing and you never have to take home work.,"Co-workers constantly joked about committing suicide because they hated the job so much. Eventually, someone thought it funny to place a jar on top of one of the cubicles and have everyone put money in the jar each time they wanted to commit suicide. You would regularly hear the drop of a coin in the jar and the office would erupt in laughter. MIND YOU, this is happening right next to the managers who laughed along too. And if you think that alone is bad enough, they eventually took the money and had a pizza party. Absolutely disgraceful. When if comes to promotions, I knew people who had been with CDK for many years and were only a Web Design Specialist 1. But the people who were in good with management would get raises before their 1 year anniversary. Also, as a contractor they will tell you they are going to hire you full time, but I was one of the last contractors to actually have that happen. They just string along contractors with false hope BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE CHEAPER LABOR IN INDIA. And then there is the bed bugs. Holy moly. The other reviews are true. Bed bugs were found (again and again) so they fumigated the office overnight. Many of us asked to work from home that day because we didn't feel comfortable sitting in an enclosed office space with no open windows. Needless to say, we didn't get to go home. And last but not least......CDK HR is HORRENDOUS . This is going to make me loose my anonymity, but who cares. I suffered a back injury while working at CDK. Instead of just letting me work from home while I healed, they forced me to take a leave of absence. Fine. Whatever. I'll take a month off work. But when I came back I made it through half a day before my back and nerve pain had returned, so HR sent me home, this time to WORK FROM HOME while they found me a new chair. Prior to coming back to work, they requested my Physical Therapist ""prescribe"" a proper chair for me. You should have seen my PTs face when I asked her for this. She literally said ""Im a Doctor... not an interior designer."" But she put together a bulleted list of requirements for my new chair. After several months, they told me they had a chair for me-- they told me it was a free sample that a vendor sent them (that should have been my big clue into their ineptness). When I got there, it was a chair that DID NOT meet all of the prescribed requirements, and again I only was able to make it half a day before going home again. IT TOOK THEM 3 MORE MONTHS until they were able to find me a suitable chair. SMH. I left CDK as soon as I had the chance and have never regretted it.","1.0

Executives treat people like objects, not people or workers who have contributed diligently towards the success of the company. -Dated code using old broken frameworks and depreciated versions with very poor organization to code, bad version control, etc. As the company only uses very old tech, and there is almost no organization to their big ball of mud, using more modern languages, frameworks, etc. is highly frowned upon and would near impossible to implement.

Management just doesn't care, and ignores everything around them. New initiatives are lip service and done by a few people, but yet get nowhere fast. HR will go on the record and say that they're happy if we're considered a below average employer.","1.0

Salary and benefits are not competitive compared to other companies. Most talented employees and managers have been leaving due to layoffs, moral and reasons listed here. Leaving those of us left to do more with less investment or support and managers who know nothing and cannot plan. Training for internal hires is poor. Sink or swim.

Parking garage is right next to building. Free bagels on Monday. Benefits aren't the worst. 401k is pretty good. Pay isn't bad.,"Was great when I first started 3 years ago. Then the company switched to a different CEO and decided to change the support model, outsource to India, and lay off entire departments and tons of other people for reasons that were never made clear to us other than ""a change in management organization"". This included demoting or laying off the good supervisors and keeping the few remaining ones who were either downright awful or just don't know what they're doing. They hemmorage staff and don't replace them, but continue to install 60+ new clients a month, and expect the same minimal amount of support to be enough. Cases are constantly backlogged with no sign of recovery. My department is half the size is was 3 years ago and we have 4x as many clients as we did then. And they wonder why we can't provide effective support, and won't hire anyone else for our department. No communication between departments or from upper management to certain departments. They always input temporary solutions that never get real solutions when it comes to backlog. QA is production, they basically just have the Devs roll out whatever they've made with minimal testing (if any) so defects are in the thousands and they take years to get fixed (if ever). Company seems to think that just forcing more work on the few left and tagging the emails with ""Be Positive"" is a good solution. I waited for 2 years for this place to get its act together because they kept saying ""just be patient, things will improve"". I think 2 years is patient enough. And things are just getting worse by the day. If all you need is decent pay and benefits and you're desperate for that, go for it. But for your sanity (and probably job stability) I wouldn't recommend it. There's a new CEO now and in his defense I think he's trying to fix things but I'm done waiting around.","1.0

Vacation policy is good as well.,"Fun fact, you’re looking at a company that was ranked in the top 10 worst companies to work for. CDK truly lives up to that title. Ever since CDK split from ADP it’s been downhill. In the past 5 years CDK has slashed every employee benefit to the bare bones. Bonuses were removed, employees are now forced to pay $130 monthly to park on site, healthcare was gutted, and raises do not keep up with cost of living increases. There have been constant layoffs, moral is at an all time low. Recently we were given just a few days notice alerting us that we would now be working until midnight, including Saturdays and on call Sundays. We were expected to volunteer for these shifts with no details available, including pay. There would be some leeway given here if there was potential to advance in the company. But there are no advancement opportunities available, and no positions are being back filled as people leave. Most departments no longer have enough people to support their product and management continues to burn out the few associates they have left. I truly feel sorry for our clients, if management continues to travel this path there simply will be no one on the phone to help them. We have products with thousands of clients being supported by 6 or less people. It takes 6-12 months to train someone to support these products. So if you’re a client unhappy about hold times it’s just going to get worst, if it ever gets better. Many of the brightest associates are leaving to find new jobs because there simply isn’t a future here. I’m currently job hunting.","1.0

Peer driven leadership is amazing at CDK and what makes it okay to work there in the beginning.

A teammate stepped up and threatened to quit if we did not reimburse them. Another client realized they were over billed but not the exact amount and asked for an much lower than what they were owed. A Director ( my boss's boss) in my department then tried to upsell them 90k advertising package as a distraction from their over payment. I had to directly lie to them. A third account paid for a service that they did not receive for an entire year because the salesperson never created the Account Plan for it in the CRM. The breaking point for me was blatant racism that no one addressed.

There was a time when this company was actually focused on providing customers and clients with a good experience. You were given quite a bit of freedom in how you accomplished tasks, and were rewarded well for the time spent. Both offices used to be teeming with helpful, supportive coworkers who always had time to help. Used to. Were. Was. Not anymore.","Let's get this one out of the way. It is morally reprehensible to attempt posting so many fake positive reviews on Glassdoor. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Any person could take a few seconds to invalidate any of these reviews. It's sad that you can no longer find any employees willing to write a legitimate positive review for this company. Let's start with your shady business practices. You are well within your right to hire contractors as much and for as long as you like. However, don't you dare make consistent promises to hire these people full time, and then string them along with some non-existent carrot. We all know the reasons. You opened up the office in Hyderabad, India, because you can realistically pay 3 of them for the price of one of us (if you even remotely paid us well, to begin with. It's why our job title is Web Design Specialist, and not Web Designer, so you can do that.) This practice is not new, nor is it uncommon. I know the people in our Indian office. They're hard workers. Good people. What's wrong is the way you are deceiving clients and customers. The folks in India are being asked to work in an industry that is vastly different than in their country, following instructions that can baffle even native English speakers. You have expressly forbade this team with communicating with clients, and instead have the team Stateside essentially play cleanup fixing (understandable) typos and communicating with clients, taking up time we could be using to help our customers. Back on the topic of contractor treatment, there have been innumerable instances where an employee could rightfully sue CDK Global for their actions (and in at least one case, this did happen, and CDK lost). A manager intercepted an HR complaint filed against one of her ""favorite"" employees for making a racist comment. Needless to say, the victim was a contractor, and they definitely found a reason to fire her. In another case, a contractor with chronic migraines had to take regular days off (contractors do not get PTO, they simply do not get paid). After providing medical evidence and a legal doctor's note about their condition, they were let go less than a week later for being ""away from their desk too often"". We also had a disabled employee in a motorized wheelchair, whom would have to wait outside the office floor every day because the company failed to provide a working handicap-accessible door. Then there are the health and safety violations. Bed bug infestations (yes, plural) have happened, and rather than closing the office to allow employees to work remotely, the building was sprayed overnight and everyone was made to come in the next day. An electrical fire broke out from one of the microwaves, and rather than evacuate, everyone was asked to continue working. The fumes for the rest of the day were so bad, that surgical masks were passed out to employees (not by management of course, but a fellow coworker). This brings me to our technology. We live in a constant state of building the metaphorical airplane in the air. Our proprietary platform is still missing promised features from it's launch over two years ago. It is missing features that were common in the platform's previous iteration. We are completely unable to respond to requests that our competitor's handle with ease, and are expressly forbidden from doing any sort of custom work to suit a customer's needs, no matter how small or large. Explicitly, this means no usage of HTML or CSS whatsoever. From a web designer. For a website company. In 2018. At the base level, we have no recovery tools. If content is deleted from a customer's website, or if published changes need to be undone, it is simply not possible. The customer's data and content is so vulnerable, how could you possibly trust us to take care of it? Things that are gone are gone forever, and that is just reprehensible. We do not even have a reliable way to center text on a web page. Think about that for a moment. If we are unable to perform such a basic task, how can we possibly be a leading tech company? You are a mockery. A farce. It's at this point, I must remind you that I am not speaking about a fictional company. This company is real. This company is doing all of these things and is getting worse by the day. This is CDK Global, and they truly deserve the reputation that they have gained.","1.0

Call us what we really are, Retention Specialists. We offer no graphic design as we follow templates, and no web design - as coding is even a fireable offense. We are simply on the frontlines against a frustrated customer base, told that our priority is to appease retain customers when we know they deserve far better.

ELT is leveraging the company to the hilt to execute stock buybacks, artificially inflating share price, assuring CDK’s eventual demise, leaving clients holding the bag. Margins are manipulated solely through layoffs and outsourcing to India. They’ve allocated $250 million to pay severance in 2019. Does this sound like a company with any kind of future? This is the same type of corporate malfeasance perpetrated against Toys ‘R Us, against Remington arms, against a multitude of formerly stable companies. I just today read that an HR person left Sears to join CDK. That’s like running from a blazing building into another blazing building. CDK is hemorrhaging employees such that they’ve mounted most of the cubicles on wheels to adjust for each week’s egress. The new flagship product currently under development is so riddled with technical debt, that if it were actual debt, the project would be forced into bankruptcy.","1.0

Tue Oct 16 2018 14:10:59 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,, ,Toxic people. Toxic model. Toxic Company. Felt like a Cult.,I worked at CDK Global for more than 3 years,"When I first started at CDK I had a wonderful manager within a very technical role within the organization. Like several quality managers, he was forced out by bad leadership, and was told he either needed to quit or be fired. The positive piece was being surrounded by some decent people before the several rounds of layoffs, people quitting, or being fired. The only people left are like vultures who behave barbarically to everyone around them. I was able to learn quite a few technical skills during my time, and the experience and responsibility (despite it being way out of my pay-grade) taught me a lot about my professional career goals.","You can literally absorb another person's role after they quit/get fired, and not receive any recognition, appreciate, pay-raise--anything. Nothing. In-fact the more you shine in this company, the more they try to come for blood and ill-willed attempts to break your spirit. There is zero sensitivity to treating people like humans, so be prepared to be viewed as nothing but a laborer and work horse. It was by far one of the most dehumanizing environments I have ever been in. Depending on your team (despite if you are salaried) your time will potentially be micromanaged with hypocrisy all over the place. Some co-workers can go on multiple coffee breaks, take long lunches, and go to the gym and not be spoken to. However, if you leave at the end of your day having completed all of your projects on time, or after helping others, it is typical to receive passive aggressive e-mails stating that expectations are to be in the office until everyone's work is completed. They definitely don't adhere to the laws governing meals and rest breaks. There are clicks of late 20 year olds, and into the mid 30's, that bond together in high-school packs plagued with gossip and UN-professionalism. They seek out new ways to belittle others through extremely passive aggressive forms of exclusion from group events, such as happy hours, snap chat groups, lunches, multiple outlook aliases, etc. When it comes to disagreeing with management in anyway, you will be seen as abrasive and combative. There is no way you can sugar coat your language that will suffice their needs. Once they have you on their radar, they will do everything in their power to begin manufacturing a case against you. It doesn't matter how well you perform or communicate with others. Your work will not speak for itself, and will continue to be undermined or viewed as a threat. It is impossible to please them by working harder or faster, so dragging your work out and doing the bear minimum is your best bet if you're stuck in that place. If you're stuck there, you have to be willing to NOT receive any professional feedback or encouragement for the extra work that you do. There will be no sings of praise, unless you are drinking their bland koolaid and saying yes to everything with a smile on your face the entire time. It legitimately felt like a cult I couldn't get out of. Nobody deserves to work in such a hostile place. Value yourself enough, and don't bother with this place. I know many people who look at labor laws, and believe several of the way CDK has handled situations have been questionable and shady. The list goes on and on. If you have any self-respect you will not put yourself through this.","1.0

A completely-successful goal can be arbitrarily graded as a 1 out of 5 and there's nothing you can do about it. Raises and bonuses are tied to these grades, so essentially managers can deny bonus and/or raises with impunity. Salaries here at least within my group are 15-25% below comparable salaries elsewhere. It's no secret that bonuses this year were reduced so that EBITDA goals could be pumped up to allow executive management to receive their full bonuses. Management does not communicate well, and there is the constant threat of immediate and random same-day layoffs. Work responsibilities often require more than 40 hours per week for most team members. Work perks such as educational tools have been severely curtailed over the past few years and we no longer have access to tools such as udemy or pluralsight for continuing education. There is no budget allocated for training events, which leads to skill stagnation. Management cannot be trusted; one case in point is that they decided to cut rollover vacation from more than 8 weeks down to only 1 week. The announcement was made to everyone on December 26th, meaning that the company essentially stole everyone's earned vacation time...some people on the team lost 4-5 weeks of earned vacation with absolutely no recourse. Advancement? Don't count on it. I've been here close to ten years and have seen only one promotion within my group. Meanwhile they have hired outside resources in the grade that I should have already been promoted to based on skill and product knowledge. Overall, a very stressful and unrewarding place to work.","1.0

I’m sorry I didn’t listen, Leo. Let me take you on a journey. When I started at CDK, it all seemed really cool. The location is great, and we’re on the 28th and 29th floors, which makes for great snapchats. The people also seemed really nice, and there were people I got along with right away and are still my friends, even though they’ve moved to better things. It was even fun the first couple of weeks in training, because I had the freedom to be creative while learning the very specific in-house platform that we use. Things started to fall apart when I really got out of training and into the actual work. The way the amount of work done is measured is incredibly skewed. You can work on a case where you create 16 graphics for a dealer’s website and spend the time to make them look really nice and get the same amount of credit as someone who checked a box on a website. Since there’s no way to get credit for actual good work that you put a lot of time into, and you can actually get punished for not doing enough cases, most people here just pick out the easy cases or put in the bare minimum effort to get it done. This is not a comment on the work ethic of my team, but rather management’s incompetence and inability to recognize or incentivize quality work. A lot of people here were hired in on contract (why treat people well and give them benefits when you can get a no obligation test drive, amirite?) with the promise that there was a “high likelihood of converting to permanent full time CDK positions”, but that’s a lie. The real way to get hired on was to go to lunch with and make breakfast for the manager that had the most pull with upper management. You could also get it by telling this manager very personal details about your life and making her feel bad for you, but if you refused to reveal your life story, you were blacklisted. You may think this is an exaggeration, but I assure you, it’s 100% true. This kind of blatant nepotism has caused terrible employees who have no idea what good design is, no idea how our platform actually works, and who regularly fall asleep at their desks to move up in the company. The worst part is, upper management watched this happen and, while they always said they would try to make things better, did nothing to actually address these issues. Speaking of management, none of the managers know what our department actually does. The managers we have come from different places within the company, which would have been a good idea if there were at least one manager for the content team that actually had experience working on the content team. Instead, we’re forced constantly forced to explain why our problems are actual problems and why we can’t make 16 good slides and upload them all to a dealer’s website in 30 minutes, which is then communicated to upper management, like some inefficient, dystopian game of telephone. Upper management then either completely forgets what they’re told or doesn’t care, and gets upset at middle management when not enough cases are done, making middle management put more pressure on us. If there were just one (1) person on any management team who knew what a PSD is, I think this problem could have been avoided. On top of not getting credit for good work and management not knowing what we do, our team in India often produces poor quality work, if they can even interpret the request. This isn’t entirely their fault, since other departments or dealers often send in cases with instructions that are unclear, don’t provide all the information, or are just completely illegible. TCS gets trash, produces trash, and then we are obligated to fix it. This constant stream of mistakes and drop in quality has made dealers, GM, and CDK employees absolutely livid, and I honestly can’t imagine anyone in upper management truly believing TCS would be a good thing for the company when they cannot reach out for more information, and when there is no expectation for other departments to do quality work. While I’m on the subject of other departments, let me take a moment to tell you about that whole mess. When I signed on for this role, my job was to grab a case, reach out to the Account Advocate if any clarification was needed, and close it. Over the past year, I feel as though many of the duties of other departments have been pushed onto us. For example, Advocates have asked myself and multiple team members to reach out to the dealers for information. This is not our job, and we shouldn’t be expected to do the jobs of other departments. Still, we are often told to do things like this anyway because it provides a “good customer experience”. That would be all fine and dandy if TCS weren’t consistently providing a terrible customer experience and suffers (seemingly) no consequences. Now that I am about 900 words into this review, you may think I’m done, but no! Let me take some time to tell you about the door. There’s a disabled employee in the office, and since CDK couldn’t find a way to weasel out of ADA compliancy, they had to put a button on one of the office doors so it would open. They delivered on the button after a couple months, but that door still doesn’t work properly. It will almost never open on the first try, and sometimes won’t even open at all. It broke constantly for months, and apparently no one could figure out why. How many CDK employees does it take to fix a door? We still don’t know. I think I’ve now gone over every terrible thing everyone else has covered, but there’s something I haven’t seen on here yet; the microwave incident. A couple months back, we noticed there was smoke coming from the kitchen, and we soon realized that the microwave was literally on fire. Instead of evacuating everyone like a normal, ethical company would do, we had to take it upon ourselves to get out of the building. When we came back in, we were told everything was fine and to continue work as usual. We could have worked from home to minimize the possibility of inhaling dangerous fumes, or taken a half day, but no. I don’t even recall it being actually addressed by management. This isn’t the only time employee safety was blatantly ignored, but it’s one that hasn’t been mentioned. Overall, this company only cares about cutting costs, at any cost to employee well being or basic human decency. This place was spiraling towards the ground when I started, and now it has hit the ground and began drilling into the earth. I would honestly pay to see the day they hit that molten core and burst into flames, because it’s coming soon.","1.0

I’ve acquired so many skills as a result and the experience I gained there has made me extremely marketable to other companies.,"The pay would have been laughable if t weren’t for the fact that such low wages devastated so many of the employees. Pretty much everything has already been said in these Glassdoor reviews. It’s a heaping dumpster fire of a company, and it’s circling the drain, so don’t bother. Looks like they’re about to sell it/gut it, so don’t waste your time. If you’re currently there, just keep looking for other jobs. Don’t get upset or hung up on trying to fix things. Chances are, you’re not doing anything wrong. It’s just a failed company, that’s all. Just take care of yourself and quietly get out of there as soon as you can. Since everything else has already been said, here’s a fun story about how CDK can’t even keep it together in some of the most basic possible ways: One time, The facilities management company of the building sent out an email to all companies in the building saying that there had been a break in the water main- told not to drink the water or use the bathrooms, and the management company suggested that everyone evacuate the building. Shortly after the email was sent out, the manager of our department left for the day. Refused to answer any phone calls or any emails… just peaced out of there without a single word, not even halfway through the day. We tried to find anyone else who could give us an update on what to do. Finally, one of our department managers crummy little minions messaged our department saying ‘everything is fine now. There are water bottles available, and it’s safe to use the bathrooms again, and that we were not to leave’. Shortly after, the building management company sent an update to everyone saying that the water was still unsafe to consume, and do not use the bathrooms or flush the toilets, and it was highly encouraged that companies evacuate the building. We tried to contact the manager’s minion again, but, surprise surprise, they had left for the day. We contacted a manager from a different department who told us everything was fine. When we questioned them about the email we had just received, encouraging evacuation, they never responded. Finally, with no other options left, we reached out to a manager in a different state, who informed us everything is fine. Shortly after that, the building management sent out another update stating that the water was still unsafe, bathrooms could not be used, and that they were expecting the bathrooms to work tomorrow, but the drinking water would be unsafe for at least another day or two. We contacted the Out of state manager again, who appeared to be away from their desk for the rest of the day. Who knows. Maybe they were enjoying the luxuries of being able to take a crap at their office. Oh, and the office had bed bugs a few times. That’s the extent of how absolutely pathetic this dumpster fire of a company is. Some of the most basic functions of EXISTING are completely lost on them. It’s a miracle they’re capable of putting clothes on every morning. I feel bad for the dealers who have to deal with this smoldering tire fire of a business. I could go on for days about how breathtakingly awful and profoundly stupid this company is, but lots of folks have already covered most of it. But my point here is that they can’t even handle extremely basic functions such as ‘running water and restrooms for employees’, at one point, so the bar is unbelievably low.","1.0

I'm just going to list out everything that happened or was an issue: -Promotions and projects are based on whether or not you're actively kissing management's tushy. You could be the most incompetent graphic designer whom clients regularly complain about, but if you make your manager breakfast/ refer to them as your mother (this is not an exaggeration,) you will be rewarded with promotions and projects. Hard work and skills means literally nothing, and loyalty will save you when you tell everyone to use the wrong branding colors for well over a year. -The most unethical hiring practices I've ever heard of. If you told me that CDK had some sort of backdoor deal with contracting companies, I'd believe you. People would REGULARLY have their contracts extended well past when they were initially told they would be considered for full time positions (and then would not be notified of the change to their contracts.) I've witnessed management lie to potential employees that there is a chance they will be hired on after the initial contracting period. That will not happen. Do not fall for it. -Management refusing to give employees their employment contracts. -Extremely low pay, and extremely varied. People in the same department, in the same position, with the same background and experience were paid $15 to $22. -People who were lucky enough to be hired on were often offered substantially lower pay than they made as a contractor, and were told the rates were non-negotiable. -Bed bugs. Several times. It probably happened because CDK pays so little that employees have to find housing in less than desirable situations. Management kept quiet on several reportings of bed bugs over a period of a few weeks. When the office was finally sprayed, employees were ordered to come in (even though most are perfectly capable of working from home) less than 12 hours from when the poison was sprayed (and is apparently still toxic if inhaled before then.) There were several pregnant women who were forced to come in. Zero humanity displayed from management. -Oh, every single job is being outsourced to India. If a problem was bought up to management (like Indian team members turning in extremely subpar work that was making clients incredibly angry) we were told ""please support your Indian team members."" -Employees were instructed by management to make it appear as if work done by the Indian team was actually done by US team members. Yet another extremely unethical business choice. -Your schedule could be changed on a whim, and if you didn't like it, oh well. -Benefits increasingly got worse and worse. The health insurance was extremely laughable. -95% of employees that left had to argue with HR to receive the full amount on their paychecks. I know of at least two instances where CDK argued that former employees actually owed them money. -We couldn't use the water in the building several times (e.g. no drinking water, couldn't use the bathroom, building management tried to force us to leave, etc..) -Our parking expenses were just straight up not covered. -The micromanagement from middle management. We're talking ""why didn't you do 11 cases instead of 10?"" each and every day. -The training provided was a complete joke. It would take months to train someone, and then they would be cut because management didn't like them as a person. Often, employees would start without laptops, or permissions to basic programs. It could take up to a week to get permissions. There was no training material in the content department for several years, as it was provided strictly orally. -Rampant racism can be found if you know where to look. -The clear psychological erosion from middle management. They will tell you literally whatever they think you want to hear, and then ban you from any promotions or projects because you bought up a business issue. -The issues within management. There are actually fantastic people just trying to earn a paycheck. However, they aren't invited out to dinners with their management, invited to exclusive birthday parties with other management, and they're disrespected on a daily basis for treating their teams like people. CDK management is like high school times one million. It absolutely could be a reality show if it wouldn't be extremely soul crushing to watch. -The content department was the lowest rung on the totem pole. Ineffective, unprofessional, and consistent problem employees from other departments would regularly belittle, mock, and go out of their way to make life difficult for the content team by sending in sub-par requests that were impossible to complete. Instead of reaching across the aisle and using these issues as teaching moment, management would ream you out and consistently take the side of other departments. -Zero opportunities for professional development, and zero transferrable skills. -The technology was extremely outdated, clunky, and down quite a bit. If I were a client, I would be absolutely livid. -I would say conservatively 40% of the current management has left from all departments. Even the fleas are jumping off this drowning pig.","1.0

There was favoritism everywhere. People would get laid off because their role was ‘eliminated’ only to have the exact role suggested to them by sites like Glassdoor a week later. Investors need to keep an eye on this CEO and his cronies. If the bottom line looks good it is because they had a round of layoffs that quarter. They aren’t making money they are cutting expenses. Cutting expenses by cutting jobs will only get you so far. The activists investors that came in a few years ago would have been better off taking over the company and selling off the parts. Maybe they still will. The hype around the spinoff from ADP was that they wanted to focus on core competencies. The truth is they were cutting dead weight.,"1.0

Great team members. Line-level management is well-meaning and works hard to keep everyone growing professionally.,"After the spin-off (October 2015), CDK was targeted by profit-seeking investors. Their motivation was to make the company more profitable and sell it to make a profit. This is a well understood strategy and (in and of itself) not a cause for concern. The problem was the implementation. Big Mac and the executive leadership team did not follow a well rationed plan: sell of lower-margin products, consolidate product lines, seek efficiency in product delivery, etc... Rather, they made staffing cuts here and there hoping they'd get to the magic margin number that would attract a buyer. This didn't happen in 3 years and the leadership became more frantic. The layoff in June of 2018 was a sign of how bad things have gotten. Between the layoff and the number of veteran employees leaving in September (when bonuses are being paid out), the company will not have any real experience on the floor to keep the lights on. They'll be hiring contractors only (at a premium) with no experience with the product set or customer needs. The next 3 years will be a struggle to maintain any semblance of a functioning company. I predict employees and customers will leave in droves.","1.0

This would be ok IF it was handled properly. The way the executives are creating shareholder value is by cutting cost so drastically it will eventually reflect negatively on value, leaving shareholders holding the bag (and it won't be money) The leadership team, and I use this term loosely, has created a culture of fear and instability for their employees and frustration for their customers. Employees are being cut regularly. Key employees are being let go and their departure has left huge gaps in the business. This leaves other employees floundering as they try to fix the damage. The morale overall is terrible as more employees become disengaged. The latest hit to the employees was the dramatically reduced bonuses due to the company missing revenues. Customers are frustrated by lack of support, delays in installations, and product instability to name a few.

Other than that, none.","I worked at CDK for a little over three years. It was never an amazing place to work, but it was alright in the beginning. It all went downhill from there. I’m 100% not surprised it was recently ranked as one of the worst companies to work for. First of all, the people. In my department at least, I felt like I was going to high school every day. So much gossiping, rumor spreading, and talking negatively about other people behind their backs. It was hard to connect with people because I didn’t know who to trust and I didn’t want to be involved in that. The workplace felt toxic. CDK does (or did) have a few great people, but oddly it seems that they all end up getting laid off eventually. I used to have an awesome manager at CDK, but his manager ended up taking over for my team, and I have never worked for someone so condescending and passive aggressive. I would be in phone meetings with her at home, with my phone on speakerphone, and my roommate was in disbelief at how she was speaking towards me and our team. I honestly don’t know how she is still employed there. Oh wait, it’s CDK, and they’re ranked one of the worst companies. Makes sense, actually. We were also forced to work 14 hour work days (at work until midnight) and were expected to be in a “war room” all day. No time set for breaks. That’s illegal, but again, terrible company and manager so I’m not surprised. Next, the work itself. Don’t even get me started on this. Let’s go with a metaphor. CDK is basically a junkyard car built with a bunch of random parts that shouldn’t go together and there’s no way it should work, but somehow it manages to just squeak by. However, it literally breaks down every day and if one part breaks, you quickly and lazily replace it with a similar part that *might* fix the car, but it won’t be as efficient as actually putting in the time, effort, and research to properly fix it so that it runs smoothly and effortlessly. Oh, and let’s say this car is being entered into a race. You tell EVERYONE (and I mean everyone) that your car is going to be the best and win the race. You also tell them that they should place their bets on it before you even see if it actually drives. You ignore everyone who suggests this might not be the best idea and you also ignore any suggestions for improvement. And then for some reason, you wonder why your car broke down in the middle of the race. Crazy, right? That’s CDK’s normal. CDK is very reactive, instead of proactive. They prefer to wait until something goes wrong before they fix something. I can’t even count how many times I asked for necessary and important improvements to be made to tools/processes and was completely ignored. Then when something went wrong that the improvement I asked for would have prevented, it becomes a huge issue and people finally start listening. Speaking of listening to their employees. I also did not get a chance to fill out an exit survey. I put in my two weeks and four days later was told they were going to let me go early. I emailed HR and asked if there was any way I could have my exit survey sent to my personal email address (they were planning on sending it to my CDK email). They told me they don’t send them to personal emails and essentially because I wouldn’t have access to my CDK email to fill it out when it came through, I was out of luck. Part of me thinks I was let go early BECAUSE management didn’t want me to fill out the exit survey. My last complaint - CDK doesn’t give a lot of their employees the position title they should have, and I think that’s because they don’t want to pay them as much as a position with that title normally would have. A lot of their employees should be making a lot more money than they do.","1.0

The future looked bright and then the new CEO Brian and his executives came into the fray beholden to shareholders and not the stakeholders. Employee layoffs abounded and reductions to benefits for employees are meant to drive long-term talent to leave the company. All hiring of north America backfill positions is frozen. All contract employment is being canceled after broken promises of conversion to full-time employment. Empty bench seats are empty as entire core teams disappear. This entire time the SLT has espoused fake news about making the company better, but has showed they only really care about driving the stock prices higher to meet short-term gains. Executive decisions go against all logic when you look at them until you realize they are concertedly working to only keep the lights on while forcing out ""expensive"" employees. The tightening of expenses and support is obtuse at best or an internally calculated attack on the companies long term stability and health to make it open to acquisition. Major client systems are ran without high availability or disaster recovery plans. Products sold to customers are cobbled together and held in place with duct tape. Subject matter experts are forced to leave or are laid off without regard for product health or support, but they keep selling more and oversubscribing. CDK at its core is a technology company providing SaaS and PaaS services. Plain and simple the SLT does not have the acumen or skills to lead this type of company. They are resorting to old business tricks (that failed terribly at Hertz!) to make the company appear healthy and profitable. Anything that can be done to increase the shareholder value is a fair game.","1.0

They cut staff but expect the same level of output from the remaining few. So either your left without a paycheck or with twice the work. Complete lack of long term vision. Executive management appears to have no idea what the core business is or how to make money from it. Every 6 months there is another re-org that changes nothing but creates disruption. This is always done in the name of efficiency which is a farce. One look at the company numbers tells you everything you need to know about their execution. All the layoffs, executive shuffles and Zero Based budgeting rounds have produced nothing. They fail to execute time and time again. When they fail, they blame the staff and perform another round of layoffs. The executive team lacks the integrity to at least have a real person notify an employee of being laid off. Some employees were notified via a pre-recorded video, others were notified on a video conference call. When the executive team lacks the vision to take a company forward it should at least be there for those employees losing their job because of their failure.","1.0

Tenured associates are now laid off in waves of 500+, support staff is now pretty much based in India where tenure and knowledge levels are years less than in the U.S, and treating the client well is overlooked. The main objective of upper management is to cut costs with the thought it will drive up stock price, or fatten their wallets when the company is sold.

The employees who remain after several layoffs are good, smart people.","The focus of upper management is to plump up the bottom line, thus making it attractive to private equity firms. This is not a rumor. You can find articles posted on the internet last January about a failed sale attempt. CDK's customers and employees are bearing the brunt of of this focus. CDK has made a concerted effort to move jobs from the US to India. In addition to many Americans being let go, those remaining are expected to work early mornings and/or late evenings to accommodate the Indian developers' work schedule. Frequent layoffs have been a catalyst for the evolution of a toxic work culture. Workers find little inspiration in not knowing from one day to the next if they or their colleagues will be let go. Loyalty to the company is not a desirable characteristic. Younger employees are quitting CDK at what looks to be an accelerating rate. A catastrophic effect of the layoffs is the loss of domain knowledge. Increasingly, no one can learn how things work or how to get things done because those who did know are no longer around. Tasks that used to take hours now can take days, if they even can be done at all. Benefits have suffered, especially health insurance. CDK claims to have benefits competitive with the rest of the industry, but anecdotal evidence belies this. Premiums rise every year, along with deductibles. The office environment is abysmal. Long rows of tables serve as work areas. Employees are spaced six feet apart from right to left and about five feet from those sitting in the next row. This is mitigated somewhat by the number of employees who have chosen to work from home. Some employees feel the need to talk loudly on the phone with no regard for their colleagues. Complaints to management fall on deaf ears. CDK no longer pays for parking. The net result for the CDK's customers is a decline in service and quality.","1.0

Recently, the company actually instructed its employees NOT to go to Glass Door to post reviews. They wanted it done internally. As if they controlled every aspect of their employees lives. And, I believe a lot of the positive reviews on here are probably planted, so the very low 2.6 overall rating should probably be even lower.

CDK’s stock has not come close to beating a generic ETF fund since his arrival. What is more damaging than Brian’s immediate impact is the devastation which his strategies will leave behind. A software as a services company needs thought leadership in its engineering ranks. Now there is none, having all been relaplaced at CDK replaced by 2 CTO/CIO flunkies who couldn’t craft a tech strategy or build a high performing organization if their children’s lives depended on it. Services are the other side of that coin & Brian’s ‘tranaformation’ has wreaked havoc there as well.

New management appeared from nowhere and were arrogant beyond anything I had ever seen. In the first meeting a vice president smiled as he said things that we all knew were lies as if to see if anyone would challenge him. Everyone left the meeting in silence. In the first layoff, they claimed that they couldn't decide whether or not to lay one employee off, so they made him write an essay to tell them why he's important to the organization -- yes, they made him beg for his job. They laid him off anyway. After that our manager asked us for feedback on how to improve things. The two people who offered suggestions were laid off in the next round. We quickly learned not to make suggestions or complain about anything. The offshoring of development was terrible. You needed to call India regularly to make sure they were doing what you thought they were doing. The time I didn't do this, I found that they were writing code in a different language than what we told them to use. My boss said that offshore code should only require ""a tweak or two"" before we test it, but everything we got from them was incomplete or defective required a lot of rework. There was no way to prevent it. Management seemed obsessed with the stock price. I heard one manager complaining that the stock price of Broadridge (an earlier ADP spin off) was soaring and he couldn't understand why CDK's wasn't. There were never any long term goals, and our customers were becoming so frustrated with our new products that we were unable to ship any new code for months which turned our agile development into a farce.","1.0

I gave them a chance to address the concerns and for months I was told that they were working on it, but I left the company feeling like they never would have adequately addressed my concerns - Offshore model is ingrained in the company's DNA, which surfaces in the form of imposing off-hour meetings and on-shore resources serving as first-line support and troubleshooting - Poor work-life balance; not only did the meetings with offshore impose significantly on my personal life, but my manager called me on weekends and evenings on multiple occasions for production support. In order to be promoted, you need to put in the extra hours and I observed that the more senior one became, the more their work-life balance suffered. Pager duty on my team. - Mediocrity is fully accepted; I worked with multiple under-producing teammates at CDK and they were not held accountable, which felt like a toxic culture to me. A Senior Engineer on my team became like an elephant in the room for the entire team (manager included) and yet, I'm sure he's still there collecting paychecks to this day - istently asked to take technical shortcuts due to unrealistic business deadlines; this was true on almost every project at almost every turn - Business often dictates project timelines and technical solutions without regard for engineering input; plus my engineering manager and product owner bickered like a married couple frequently It seemed like almost everyone I worked with was dissatisfied in their position and many of them sought advice on how they themselves could find a way to leave the company; moving to a company where people don't hate their jobs and the company actually cares about employees was a revelation.","1.0

My position was one of the few available at this company that allowed remote work. It was not a perk. Communication between teams or even members on my own team was nearly non-existent. If you weren't in the office you weren't in the club.,"Where to start? This company had great benefits and culture under ADP. ADP cared about retaining its talent and treating them like they were valuable. When CDK split from ADP, we began focusing on attracting a new buyer rather than working in the car dealership business. Benefits went up significantly or were stripped away altogether. Internal websites are horrible and difficult to navigate; they look like a kid created them. The performance review process is awkward and again, done on a cumbersome online section of our internal website. Job processes are mind-numbingly boring because automation is non-exsistent. There was no ownership of process improvement and 90% of my ""technical"" job was filling out paperwork, emailing it manually and then uploading it. Rinse and repeat. Breaking down silos? This company is one giant silo city. Management has zero investment in employee relations or retaining their their talent. Paycheck...what paycheck? Left this company and got a 30% raise to go elsewhere after 15 years of being told ""you're average."" Right...and the monkey pushes the button. There is no career growth and if you want to work in tech this place pigeon holes you into roles that are difficult to translate to ""the real world."" I honestly feel like I just got out of an abusive relationship and found out that not all companies treat their people this way, that's how bad this place is. I wasted years of my life on a ""career"" that doesn't exist. Keep looking if you're considering a job here. If you still work here, you CAN get out. The grass IS greener elsewhere.","1.0

That's about all it has to offer.,"False Advertisement in the interview process. The test they give you contains a design part and a coding part so this makes it seem like you will be using these skills while working. That's a lie. I was there for a year and rarely did any coding. So any new coders looking to make this an entry level development job, please beware of this. The work is tedious, repetitive and definitely NOT what you expect when they advertise it to you Also, for the Content department, they tell you that you will start out as a contractor and after so many months(1-6months), you will become full time and get the benefits. That is a lie. There are people there who have been contractors for over a year and when they question management about it, their response is ""I don't know whats going on."" By being a contractor you get paid less, you don't have benefits, you don't have sick days or vacation days and they can call you after work to fire you WHENEVER they feel like it without reasoning(I know multiple people who this has happened to). I've seen a contractor who was there for THREE days get fired because the trainer ""didn't like them because they asked too many questions"" There is no such thing as a warning or write up and if management happens to give you a ""warning"", more than likely you will be fired once you get home the same day. So there is no job security and also difficult to trust what the two managers say which is ridiculous because they are the managers. There is minimal growth within the company. Upper management schedules meetings with employees to hear concerns and then cancels them because the person claims to be ""too busy."" That should give you insight about how much they care about the well being of the employees. All that seems to really matter is pleasing the stockholders. Although I was able to get in fulltime before all the madness happened with the contractor business, its sucked to see so many employees get treated unfairly while people in charged laughed behind their backs. People have families they have to provide for and the way this company is handling how they treat contractors shows that they don't really care about the well being of the employee. So that should be a red flag to anyone looking to join this department in CDK. I can't speak on other departments but as far as being a Web Specialist, I honestly would not recommend this place to anyone. This place is a revolving door when it comes to employees so I would stay clear of this company unless you really need the work.","1.0

Account loads were growing & additional duties were being added to our plates without hardly any additional pay. The bonus structure for this new sales aspect to our role is mediocre & anyone who has worked in sales will take one look at it and walk away. There were also a lot of inconsistencies with how & when we received the bonuses for the upsell we were responsible for. If an upsell wasn't inputed by the billing department by a certain date, it would no longer count for the month we had the upsell (even though we had it submitted before the deadline for that month). This would cause us to miss out on additional pay during certain months. Also, because of all these issues, it would take upwards of 5-6 months to be paid out on our upsells.

(Of course, this only works if you know how to say 'no!') - Pretty good 401K matching - If you are proactive and know how to network, CDK is known for letting internal folks from diverse teams outside of the Engineering dept. hire and promote laterally into a programming job.

Coworkers are caring, knowledgeable, and eager to help when they can.","The biggest con I can think of is the large disconnect between the VPs/""Senior Leadership""(the boys club), and the rest of the company. Through their ""leadership"" we have seen 4 rounds of layoffs some of which have been large in the last year. Although my department was never impacted in these layoffs, it still tanked moral and since no one is supposed to talk or ask questions about it (we were told not to ask by our director), everyone basically is wondering when their turn will be. Work life balance is non-existent. I experienced this as a junior engineer, and it only gets worse the more senior you get. To give some background, we are told by senior leadership that they strive to have 50-50 balance between offshore and onshore engineering workforces. However, in my almost two years at the company I was the only onshore member of my 6 man team. Yes, my department had around 20 engineers onshore, but each of those were only a tiny portion of their respective teams. Essentially, they have kept the bare minimum onshore to deal with production issues during the day time. I have no doubt that if the product was more reliable, all onshore members would be let go and replaced by offshore engineers. Back to the work life balance now, as mentioned, the majority of engineers are in India which means the onshore members consistently have to take late night meetings (at the start of the India workday), followed by early morning meetings (at the end of the India workday). When there is a production issue, which happens a good amount, engineers can expect to have 10-12 hour workdays and then still be expected to have the late night and early morning meetings to handoff and pickup the issue with the offshore teams. The company has a lot of confusion about its direction. Engineers are given fiscal year goals and these goals will impact bonuses, raises, and potentially their job status, but the goals are not achievable. There is little planning or communication with product management and engineers/architects before the goals get set either, so unrelistict expectations are set that can't be achieved. The company is trying to move to up-to-date tech stacks, but there is too much politics to play to get any new services set up. From my experience, CDK only rewards hard work by giving more hard work. Yes, you may get your yearly bonus, but don't expect a raise worth much. Pay is below average, but Glassdoor can tell you that. Benefits are pretty standard, I guess. 401k seems good until you realize that you have to wait 3 years in order for any contributions to be vested. As mentioned before, there is currently a culture of fear and low morale. When I was hired I was told that a great company culture was the greatest benefit. It has been quite a change in less than 2 years. I really am not trying to sound bitter, I left liking everyone I worked with, including the offshore engineers, but I can't agree with how the company treats the engineers and every other employee.","1.0

Found out after the fact that all client service department employees have to commit to that department for 24 months before even having a chance to move to another department in the company or you would need to have a special connection with the higher ups to be moved. This place is a super call center and CTA/Client Technical Analyst positions are actually customer service positions. Seasoned IT people will not be happy in Parts & Service, no admin rights, no computer or network troubleshooting, you will learn an application and support that application and that’s it. The hardest part will be getting the proper training so you can be successful at your job. Supervisors are not required to be trained in the application you will be supporting, so you will not be able to rely on them for help, they function as a micromanager/babysitter and when you experience problems with your supervisor or anyone in management you will not be able to turn to HR they will do nothing for you and it doesn't matter if you do a good job or have good scores and etc, you simply won't get anywhere complaining about someone in management at this place. You will need to make and be friends with other employees because this is how you will get information on how to do your job AND the supervisors will turn to them for your progress, your discipline and your annual review that will determine how fast and how much you will grow with the company. As for raises, you can get up to %3 raise and only if you are cool with the managers/supervisors will you stand any chance at getting the full %3. Much more could be said but I think you get the jest of it, I personally wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone, it’s filled with micro-managers and some on truly toxic, a superficial environment, fake promotions, employees from the original company fighting to keep their place some who will hold you back so you don’t get ahead of them.

There are truly few good things to say about CDK. Most departments are understaffed, overworked, and underpaid, which is reflected in product quality and employee morale. Pay is acceptable only if it's your first job out of college. Raises are insultingly small, and benefits get worse with time. Promotions are handed out based on favoritism; witch hunts and mistreatment based on petty personal vendettas are common. Bad management results in bitter antagonism and resentment between teams who should be working together. There are no healthy outlets for employees to voice their concerns - even the most gentle of criticism is met with hostility, and you will be punished for speaking up. Many US contractors were led to believe they would be hired full-time after a few months, only to have their contracts extended multiple times without their knowledge or consent. Meanwhile, a team was hired in India to ""help with their workload."" Numbers are worshipped at the expense of employees and customers. Upper management does not see employees as assets, but as items on a balance sheet. Zero opportunities for growth or advancement, few opportunities to learn transferable skills. They are quickly trying to outsource the bulk of the work and turn the remaining US offices into call centers. Many employees now spend most of their time cleaning up after the messes created by CDK's outsourced, poorly trained, cheap labor, and customers are increasingly unhappy. WFH is advertised but is mostly for the unlucky souls working every Saturday. Otherwise, it's not available until you've been FT for almost a year - and then you only get two days a month.* Exceptions are not made for inclement weather or unsafe office conditions. Meanwhile, managers WFH at their leisure and often with no notice. *When approved, and it can't be the day after/before a holiday or vacation day. They lie about everything. Even things that don't matter. The vast majority of employees are trying to get out as quickly as they can. The only worthwhile thing you'll get from CDK is work experience, if you need it.","1.0

Had a great support team environment of seasoned support staff in one area. As each iteration was released, issues that arose made for interesting workdays (never bored and always learning) Option to work from home was very nice.","New CEO has destroyed the culture that once drove this company to the top of it's class, with client loyalty and employees that invested back into the business for the love of their jobs. Trust in CDK is no longer there. Trying to save a buck here and there by getting rid of your most seasoned and knowledgeable employees for cheaper salaries in new hires was not the way to support a once great culture of growth. If the new CEO really wanted to invest in this company and impress the stockholders/ board members, perhaps he could have lightened his own salary a couple of million rather than ruin the lives of the actual workers in this company through layoffs, as he got rid of the backbone of support persons that actually knew the product and secured client loyalty. Clients are running for the hills as fast as they can. Benefits are a joke. Medical coverage is meticulously expensive with very little actually being covered. Employees are better off as self-pay with an agreed upon fee negotiated with doctors. Coffee, ice cream socials, and odd motivational photo shoots showing upper m management acting silly does not hide the fact that the culture is broken and cannot be rebuilt for the few clients that may remain in your end. Employees shoyld have come first, as they keep the culture alive and it is employees that build your product. You killed the culture and you killed the business. Hey, at least the CEO can lay his head on his golden pillows each night. New hires are lied to when promised a bright future with CDK, and paid pennies to take the archaic abusive practices, similar to Guantanamo Bay tactics that were built to break down and destroy the emotional and physical health of prisoners. I believe team leads and ipper msmagement must have attended their training at Gitmo. Favoritism towards certain workers who get promoted with no other skills than brown nosing. Management doesn't want to hear that they have created an atmosphere of every man for himself in survival mode, while they dangle the threat of ""your the next to go"" over everyone's heads.

The management is also looking to hire employees at lower salaries but they want top talent, in a highly competitive market.","2.0

Not much growth for career",I have been working at CDK Global full-time for less than a year,"Fairly easy job to do, decent pay starting out.","More focused on the numbers in how well we are doing versus your knowledge and ability to help customers. Your support knowledge is constantly being questioned with management from others walking by and overshadowing what they think is going on versus asking each team. Too many assumptions, little to no advancement, broken promises and not able to move into other roles, terrible benefits. Behind the times in how a tech company should treat their employees. Reprimanded for ridiculous things based upon surveys when stats are high but not higher than another team that of no relation. Managers don't talk to their teammates often, and are often clueless as to what the hot topics or culture is like within the company. Inter-office communication is very weak too. When a major company change happens, you get many different answers as to why that change happened and are expected to followed said changes because they are higher management. Don't work here if you're looking for a career job.","1.0

Sat Aug 19 2017 02:54:39 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Current Employee ,There might be worse companies to work for but all of them pay minimum wage,I have been working at CDK Global full-time for more than 8 years,I seldom have to meet management in person. I get a paycheck every two weeks. My coworkers and clients are good people.,"Repressive and fear based management. It's all about the bad things management can do to you. Excessive policies and micromanagement make everything take longer. The sticks outweigh the carrots by a large margin. Under staffing and unreasonable workloads make the sticks unavoidable and the carrots, if they exist at all, unattainable. Management is easy to talk to but there will be no positive movement, only lip service. Upper management shows no cohesive plan to get us out of the mess they've put us in other than taking it out on the employees. HR is a joke, they’ll rubber stamp anything that gets through legal review. Benefits have become significantly more expensive and more complicated to work through. There is one company car policy for us with two choices, take it or go find another job. They take $100.00 a month out of our check for personal mileage, soon to be raised to $135.00. We also pay taxes on that money. There are two reasons why most of us drive as few personal miles as possible. 1) Extreme Big Brother tracking. A gps and cellular equipped device is plugged into the OBD2 connector. The OBD2 connector knows everything that’s going on with the car right down to whether the doors are locked, brake and throttle position, turn signals, etc. This data along with location, speed, g-force and more is transmitted to a server and stored. They have reserved to right to do anything they want with the data which includes selling our driving record and location data to anyone they want as many times as they want. 2) An 18 page company car policy that forbids many every day, perfectly legal activities. You can’t even pick up a gallon of gas or lighter fluid because all flammables are forbidden. There are multiple scenarios where they reserve the right to charge you the full repair cost and a catch all for anything they missed, whatever THEY determine to be negligence. They've created a way to dishonestly and unethically profit by taking money from their employees that doesn’t belong to them. THEFT. I'd want to know where my people are too but I'd do it in a much different way. It’s just a job and I do it for a paycheck. Moral is at an all-time low everywhere. I’ll take less to work for a company that treats its people with dignity and respect and I’ll work a lot harder for them.","1.0

One major ""PRO"" would be my co-worker and our clients.","Too many to list here, but to list a few. 1st and foremost I detest being forced to pay an ever increasing “contribution” for a company provided vehicle. A “contribution” implies that I was asked and would like to contribute. The vehicle I am forced to drive is a cargo van. The vehicle is required for my job description. The vehicle was ordered for me with zero input allowed. Previous administrations allowed us to drive our own personal vehicles; however that policy was discontinued years ago. Why this company feels compelled to profit off their employees is beyond comprehension. What prompted this is reflected in the following email content. “Over the past few months, a team has been evaluating our fleet cost structure and comparing them to industry best practices. As a result of their research, we’ve found that we are not at benchmark standards and need to increase the employee contribution rate. Starting Sept. 1, 2017, the new monthly employee contribution rate will be $XXX.XX per month. The deductions will be split into two pay periods of $XX.XX each. We will continue to evaluate the contribution amount each year and communicate any changes as they occur. Thank you for your cooperation.” 2nd Yearly pay increases are dwarfed by the ever increasing cost of living. There is no consideration to re-evaluate the cost of living compared to wages. 3rd. Our very expensive health insurance. Deductibles are rising rapidly and coverages are being reduced.","1.0
