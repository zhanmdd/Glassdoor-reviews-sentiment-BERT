She kept me up to date during the whole process and would always answer all of my questions within a few minutes of me reaching out to her. She also prepared me well for the interviews by providing me with supplemental information and giving me general tips. She guided me through the whole on-boarding process step by step so it was easy for me to understand and get through. The on-boarding has been smooth sailing as well. HR made and exception and took her time to come to the office even though WFH was in place because of the Corona Virus. She helped me get settled in and provided all the essential information I needed from Sogeti to get started with the company. The HR Manager has also been readily available and answered many questions I had during my first week. My co-workers and manager have made this on-boarding process so amazing for me even tough things have been really difficult with the WFH order in place. Especially it being my first week. They have been so patient with me and guiding me through everything that I need to know at a steady pace and always there to answer any of my questions. I couldn't have asked for a better set of co-workers! Everyone is so understanding and I truly feel welcomes here. I am glad that I ended up at Sogeti!,Absolutely no cons whatsoever.,"5.0

If you want to specialize in one field and have proven to them with certifications and projects, they will place you wherever the market is. (Testing, testing, and more testing.) - If your client's employees' are off the days Sogeti is not off. You MUST use your PTO. - The PTO you earn is 2.31 hours per week which is a meager amount. - Earning a promotion takes months to process. As for bonuses, this takes 3 months and the end of each year to process. - As for promotions, expect a 5% raise from what you are currently earning. Job titles means nothing in Sogeti. - As for new grads that come into the market, it is difficult to find us a position when you are on the bench (known as ATO); however, it is the responsibility of your higher-ups to find a position for you. It just saddens me on how this all worked out. IMPORTANT: I HIGHLY recommend NOBODY to apply to Sogeti Austin as a new grad. The open contracts they have made have been lessened and broken down. People have been laid off since December who were experienced, and the deals they are trying to make has never come to fruition. If you are expecting to work on the latest tech, your best bet is to apply somewhere else. You will more than likely be put in meager positions as a Tester which is no fun. (No coding is even involved which really irks my time with Sogeti.)","3.0

Granted it won't always be in areas that you would choose.,"Management is known for arbitrarily laying off employees. (I'm sure there is a reason but I guess they are too cowardly / dishonest to admit it.) They do not treat employees fairly - some will remain ""between projects"" for weeks or months, or be warned that they will be fired if they do not find anything, while others are fired even if they were about to be placed on a new project. A lot of decisions are made based on nepotism, spite, petty grudges, or greed. Woe betide the person who earns a substantial IBP (individual bonus) but finds themselves between projects right before it's disbursed (in April). You will lose both your job AND the bonus you were told was your ""overtime"". Why is the bonus doled out so late, you ask? So that they can onboard a bunch of fresh hires in the first quarter, offboard anybody they dislike, and profit both ways. They also fire employees en masse & wait for months before offering severance.","1.0

At the time of my employment, Sogeti lost out to other firms in competition for business, causing a lack of opportunities for less experienced hires. 2.) Non-competitive/underpaid base salary. 3.) Promotions are hard to achieve and do NOT guarantee pay raises. This makes it hard want to grow and move up within the company. 3.) 401k program is designed to retain people for at least 3 years since that's when the funds are vested. Sogeti turnover is high - this is the only thing making people stay. 4.) The bonus program causes more problems than it solves. It is very subjective and employees will rarely see a bonus unless they are knocking it out of the park by out performing their peers (including those who are above them).","2.0

Thu May 30 2019 20:54:04 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Associate Consultant,"Minneapolis, MN",Former Employee ,This is a tier 2 or 3 consulting company,I worked at Sogeti full-time for less than a year,"They pay for your education and certifications. They pay for a tmobile plan. They separate their work into five different ""practices"" for you to choose. Our director gave me some good guidance.","I was a college hire and sat on the bench for 4 months with no work before I decided it was time to call it quits and find a better job. Sogeti sees college hires as cheap risks because sometimes they can make a fortune off of entry level professionals for 60-70k per year when they're getting billed at $100/hr. Our first two weeks of ""training"" consisted of watching powerpoints from mostly unenthused Sogeti consultants for 8 hours a day in Ohio. They covered topics like Java, cloud computing, DevOps, etc. These are awesome things to learn, but it's not a way to actually teach anything. People were literally falling asleep. Bench time sucks. You're not allowed to work from home unless you give them ""satisfiable"" reasons like appointments and emergencies. One week my car broke down and I ended up having to spend $200+ in ubers just to show up and do nothing. While on the bench, you're required to go to your unit office from 9-4:30 every day and sit in a conference room. Most other consulting companies understand that this is a waste of your time and will let you stay at home until they find you a project. They pride themselves to be a consulting company, but it's not always the case. In many instances it isn't different than contracting. At least half of their consultants have been on projects for 3+ years that it gets to a point where they really aren't consulting anymore, they're contracting. You have skills and expertise, but you aren't put on projects to share that knowledge. You go on a project because the client is shorthanded. Sogeti pushes consultants towards work unsuitable for their career. As a software developer, I was asked to maintain a government project that had an 18 year old, vb.NET error-filled and buggy application that only works on IE browsers. For 2 years. I said that this does nothing to further my career and rejected it. They gave me the whole rundown on how consultants need to accept anything they're given and how bad experiences can be learned from. They let me sit on the bench a while longer. It proved to me that money is more important to them than their employees. Raises are bad. I talked to a sr consultant and he said that he gets 1-2k raises each year. He had been working there for 5 years and wasn't surprised that newly hired sr consultants were earning more than him. The bonus system is strange. The top 30% of consultants earn $500-2000 monthly bonuses for doing things like satisfying clients, going to company meetings, and earning further education. There is no culture at Sogeti. Nobody seems to care or have any enthusiasm for what they do. They see it as a job that pays the bills. Which is fine for many people, but not for me.","2.0

Most work is kept at 40 Hours Capacity limit with the occasional once a month weekend support/deployment. Work from home depending on client and manager. (Heard it can change depending on pursuits and client deadlines. So don't expect this to always be the case). Work can be very interesting depending on your location and client. Work can also be boring and empty depending on what you do and how compatible it is. (I'm looking at you testing, maintenance, and QA).","Upper Management is Sales. Maybe a few picks that inch closer to tech. So you're gonna have to sell and speak their language. So many buzzwords. So many sales pitch but not enough people to just think and discuss the tech. You're gonna have to make sure your numbers look good. You don't have to present yourself well during doing client work. But for promotion season, you definitely do. Promotion is once a year! Whaaat!? Insane amount of time if you don't get promoted or was mismatched due to how the seasons went. Also, market is booming and it is a lot faster to jump to another company. (Although most people get over this because when you find your footing Sogeti is just so damn comfortable and likable). Also, the amount of work you do and whether you get promoted isn't correlated. Not enough work. This is definitely more of a location problem (Houston Unit). Only time will tell. This problem can definitely lead some senior consultants to feel like a big fish in a small pond and chase growth elsewhere. ulting brings in a lot of dread for the future. (How long will I stay with this client, will my skill set be still relevant, how much do you have to learn to make sure the next client wants me, what if the work is unenjoyable). Additionally, you might not find a client for the skill stack that you want to get involved in. It happens. Part of the job. Many will plan their parachutes if management isn't able to find a client. Pursuing to get on a client can be pretty dreadful. Sales will tell you do learn all this stuff then switch and tell you do learn other new stuff. Pretty much shotgun approach and can be pretty dreadful and you stop caring about the tech altogether.","5.0

They say they will give you work you want, but they just stick you in the first contract that pops up regardless of what it is. All they care about are sales and numbers. They try to outsource as much as possible to India and they're proud of it. I've witnessed pursuit discussions where they tout their profit margins by selling trash products hacked together in India. Absolutely no room for raises and you'll be underpaid. I started underpaid by 5k, worked for more than a year, and never even received an inflation raise. Corporate people are facades. I always disliked talking to them because it was all smoke and mirrors. The company is insanely cheap. Even the most ridiculous, trivial expenses were always denied because ""it's just not in the budget."" The turnover is really, really, high (go figure). This company has gotten worse and worse over the years. ultants that have actually stuck around for years talk about how they used to be a great company. They host happy hours, payed fairly, gave decent bonuses, etc. It's gone downhill very, very quickly in the past few years however (likely in-part due to the merger with Capgemini).","1.0

I was told by the Recruiter/Management at the time that Sogeti was not a staffing company and truly valued their 'full-time, W2, salaried' employees. I came to learn very quickly that Sogeti was indeed just a staffing company and the promises of teamwork, collaboration, and hard work towards a common goal were simply words used to bait me to accept the position. Sogeti also preached core values but they were NEVER in practice particularly at the unit management level in Indianapolis. In fact, it was just the opposite. The Indianapolis unit is built on a 'platform' of disrespect, competing agendas, and condescension. No one is truly valued and no one is ever rewarded appropriately. There has been a great deal of attrition for good reason stemming from a complete lack of professionalism and absolutely no desire to drive/increase sales, particularly at a time when the market could not be more robust with opportunity. This is especially true in one practice in particular (testing/QA). There are a few very good internal operations people but I don’t see them sticking around much longer.

Opportunity to get experience working with Fortune 500 clients. Possible work from home opportunity (depending on client/project). Overall decent place for college hires to gain the valuable experience that will land them their next job.","Non-compete agreement. Carefully hidden and strategically worded in the offer letter, is a very restrictive non-compete agreement. While I understand why companies do this; Sogeti (compared to other consulting firms in the area) stands out as being especially restrictive and inflexible in this area. By signing this deal with the devil, you give up all rights to pursue any opportunities with any client that you have had any direct exposure to during your tenure with Sogeti, for two years following your termination. So if you have dreams of working for any of the top Fortune 500 companies in your area; keep this in mind when agreeing to a new project. Lack of opportunity for advancement. Promotions/raises are only available once a year in January and are quite difficult to obtain. To be considered, you are required to make a case for yourself in the form of a few bullet points in an email. The process is 100% subjective, and the decision is entirely up to your GVP (aka someone who is too high up to know who you are, what you do, or what your value is). Promotion to a higher title is essentially meaningless; as a billable ultant your duties/responsibilities will be unaffected as they are instead entirely determined by the needs of your client/project. Hard work with long hours for your client goes unnoticed, while what you do for Sogeti (aka Sales) is rewarded. Below market average compensation. Sogeti is simply unable to pay market value for its talent, especially over time. For this reason it is absolutely crucial to negotiate a reasonable salary at hire time. The ongoing cycle is to hire kids fresh out of college for next to nothing, then keep them until they can no longer afford them (usually 1-2 years). After 1-2 years of experience working with the latest tech stacks for Fortune 500 companies, ultants leaving Sogeti can expect dramatic increases in salary. On the bench (ATO) time. While on the bench, you are expected to report to the office 8-4 Mon-Fri to sit and wait for a project. During this time, work from home is unacceptable even in case of sickness, emergency or inclement weather. This can go on for days, weeks or possibly months. There is no set time, but if on the bench for too long - you will be laid off. When a project is presented to you, it is generally not considered optional; even if the role is not a good fit with your skillset. The unspoken expectation is you remain flexible and be willing to take on any project presented to you. Flawed bonus system. Just like promotions/raises, bonuses are 100% subjective. Bonuses are awarded monthly, and paid out annually. Zero visibility on who bonuses are awarded to, or if they are even being awarded at all. Also like promotions/raises, what you can do for Sogeti (aka Sales) is rewarded while the hard work with long hours for your client will go unnoticed. The potential for achieving the max bonus of $24k/year advertised is completely unattainable. Unless entering a sales role; you should go in with the expectation of not receiving bonuses. Unethical practices from management. Management advising and helping to temporarily hide non-compliant behavior/items in order to occasional pass client audits. Management forcing ultants to exaggerate or flat out lie about skills/background advertised in order to make a sale to clients. I have overheard several conversations including dialog from management such as ""On your profile, I need you to make it SOUND like you have experience with X technology..."" Morale and office culture. Over the past couple of years, the office has taken a dive in morale. Going from not having enough open desks, to now being a empty and quiet cubicle wasteland. The office has very dated furniture and facilities. Very good chances you have a broken chair. Peripherals such as monitors, mice and keyboards are simply not provided; you are expected to bring your own. Overall, its not a happy feeling in the office. When talking to other ultants, you will find that most everyone is at least passively seeking new opportunities. Nobody seems happy to be working at Sogeti any more.","1.0

Wed Jul 18 2018 16:05:49 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Associate Consultant,"Cincinnati, OH",Former Employee ,Sick mentality,I worked at Sogeti full-time,None because I did not join them,"I was hired full time by Sogeti in April before I graduated. I was supposed to join them on 6th August 2018, after my graduation (4th August). Two weeks before joining, the lady HR who offered me the job said she along with another colleague want to have a phone call with me. On the phone, they said they have terminated my offer because immigration law has changed. The reason they offered me was since I am an international so I can not work for more than 1 hours at the client location and client is not OK with this setup. On googling for a while, I came to know this is not what the law is. The law is if you work for 1 year at the client location, the OPT does not get extended but H1B can still be applied. But of course, you can work for 8 hours per day for a year at the client location. They both staged this drama to terminate my offer without realizing how much mental pain this has caused me. They almost pushed me to the brink of nervous breakdown. Advice to any internationals who are hired by Sogeti, keep searching for a new job and the moment you find it leave Sogeti, otherwise they may kick you out without a valid reason and then you will be left with nothing.","1.0

And, if the client likes your work, it’s highly unlikely Sogeti will move you to another client. Merit increases also seem to be based on consultant profitability so same applies as bonus - if you’re not on a great account with a great rate, good luck.

Ability to accumulate different types of experience that would normally not be possible at one position. Efforts by the Austin office to include consultants in social meetings outside of work (some ""mandatory"" but have money incentive) is appreciated since consulting creates a disconnect. Has a great counselor program that allows you to communicate your progress. Includes paying for training and certifications. Has a decent 401K and health plan, at this time you get fully vested in 3 years. There is a great boot camp that ramps you up for your practice. Sogeti is at least making a conscious effort to combat gender inequality.","Hard to maintain a work-life balance as there are several out-of-work events that you are highly recommended to attend on a monthly basis.

There are some very good people.","Despite working 8 hours with a client you are still expected to drive downtown for sales calls and then back with no compensation. They tell their employees anything to keep them happy. They told me they were trying to get me a closer position for 2 years - eventually the project was done and they never moved me. Then, when I left they offered a big raise ""if they could get it approved"". Later I floated coming back (when I left, on good terms, they said to let them know if I wanted to come back) and was told at an interview that the same amount they had previously ""offered"" was not realistic. Despite my having even more knowledge and experience. I often saw them build up one of their consultants to a customer and then throw them under the bus, assuming he would ""sink or swim"". Their bonus system is misleading. The amounts given are points based and they ""allow"" the selling back of PTO for points. So, even though you strive for excellent satisfaction scores for their points, near the end of December everyone sells back their PTO. This drops you down your bonus amount and saves the company from having to give PTO. The bonus pool is a set amount based on your percentage ranking with bonus points. They only have a single high deductible insurance option, although there are no premiums. Everyone at the corporate office claims that family is first but they have a different standard for the consultant employees who actually bring in the cash.","1.0

Tue Aug 01 2017 07:14:16 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Cincinnati, OH",Current Employee ,"Decent company where the up years are ok to good, but the down years are a major struggle",I have been working at Sogeti full-time for more than 5 years,"Other reviews correct, 401k matching is one of the most legit in the consulting industry T-Mobile business plan BYOD with fairly cheap payroll deduct upgrades like extra line or extra data. Depending on your client you may not use it for business reasons often, but you still have it available for personal/business use when necessary + tethering which is always a nice perk. This straddles as a neutral for me as I knew going in, but opportunities for travel are minimal. For those with families who wish to remain local to the area, this is superb as you will not need to jet off every week or so, or drive all over the region for the clients. If you tend to get itchy feet on occasion and like to see the insides of the nation's airports, look elsewhere. Minor relocation assistance is possible if you have a specific skill for a business need. Senior guys knowledgeable and usually willing to help out the many Jr staff push their careers forward Initially: happy hours, group events, health benefits (see below), tuition reimbursement, office atmosphere Great opportunity for new grad to become established and for people late in their career to settle into and retire from without fears of age discrimination that also have been strangling the consulting industry. Depending on team, work from home and flexible hours are fantastic. Get your assignments/meetings done and you won't feel like you are slaved to the PC when the work dies down... just be available for the rest and you will be ok. This is never an excuse to slack, but more motivation to work efficiently and swiftly in a minimum amount of time which is necessary considering working hours of some international clients. People who are desperately working to keep the workplace culture alive as it has diminished over the years as teams have been split up across the units, not to be seen again for months at a time if ever again. These people are fantastic and their efforts appreciated during downturns. Various project choice allows developing your skills in any number of directions that may loosely align with your career goals, or try out subjects you otherwise would not have if it was not your main role somewhere else with little risk of failure as a deterrent. If it absolutely does not work out, you can be reassigned. Beware of chasing the in-demand skill of the day, though, as by the time you master it, the deal that prompted it may have fallen through entirely or the skill of the day has changed and you will be expected to follow suit. Pick a few technologies to specialize in and ardently stick with it - it is healthier for your future career after Sogeti to have strong talents in smaller areas than weak talents all over the board that you never actually put into practice.","Things have changed over the last few years, mostly from having too many eggs in one major basket in the Cincinnati market, and when that basket starts getting smaller, the squeeze hits everybody exceptionally hard. This has resulted in a culture shift for the worse as time has gone on from my start date, with far fewer company events, almost no happy hours, few extracurriculars after work, and generally the office feeling pretty empty when it was once jam packed and buzzing with activity on any given day. Part of this was caused by a client moving out of the building, reducing face to face visibility drastically. Bonus plan changes yearly company-wide, and you will almost certainly never see the 24k the benefits page promises or be able to draw from all the education reimbursement you have (1yr golden handcuff on that anyhow and can feel like pulling teeth to use it). Speaking of which, the great 401k plan vests at the 3 year mark as others have stated, but turnover typically beats this out by a year or so, so don't bank on it. Salaries here are lower than market average and very difficult to shake up on a down year so don't feel locked in by the vesting schedule. Sogeti was also sold as having great project mobility to align your interests and skills to a project best suited for it, but approaches this with a body shop mentality where you will be placed on next open project to keep you billing, even if it is a bad fit. Once this happens it can be exceptionally difficult to move elsewhere especially since you get pulled into that same sorting pipe again if we're currently running lean, although some people do genuinely get placed where they are most useful and where their interests align. Has a very ""bulk up the staff now, sort it out later"" feeling to it. Health benefits were sold as free premiums not more than just a year ago, even though the deductible was pretty high (nearly catastrophe plan levels), the younger workforce they employ appreciated no premiums for a plan they would use minimally anyway, so it worked out well for the majority. Recently though, the ""realities of doing business in the USA"" have caught up to us and instilled some lofty premiums for the same catastrophe level plan, with no adjustments in salary to compensate, so a benefit became a unilateral pay cut and saw a major shift in company culture that most are still bitter about. Families have taken the brunt of this issue. Finally, and this is not a problem unique to this location, but management feels like a rubber band. You reach a certain point in your career where if you want to make more $, you need to introduce sales goals into your title without exception, otherwise you hit the cap. I liken this to a rubber band because the harder it is stretched, the more stress it will feel without suitable reward. There is very little consistency at the practice manager level as there is not much reward for doing the required work of the role, and also doubled with the expectation of keeping on task with the current engagements while remaining billable. This places enormous stress on the consultants' direct leadership as the leaders will make it one year before trying to pass the role on to the next guy in line trying to climb the ladder. Very few people are able to juggle this demanding dual workload without cracking at the seams so kudos to them for holding on. What this means in your day to day life is limited engagement with the person directly responsible for your promotion, so you might need to be a bit intrusive to make sure they remember who you are in their already extremely packed lives - and spread that out over the entire practice and you can see how this can be an issue.","3.0

Benefits are great and the 401k is unmatched: 150% on 6% .,Compensation does not reflect your market value or skills and has a very low upper limit based on your position. The chances that you are placed at a client in which you can utilize your skills is low and if you are already billing at a client in which you are just a warm body placement there is little to no effort to move you to a client that needs your skills. There are a lot of promises upon hire that either change or do not get realized at all in regards to career path. I was informed during the interview process that there was a path for a technical and or enterprise software architect expertise but that is non existent. Sales support and management are their key focus for promotional requests. They encourage you to get highly certified but even if you prove yourself the most knowledgeable and obtain very high level certifications they favor less qualified people just based on age. Managers may even come to you for advice on the topic and present it as their own without acknowledgement. This affects the morale of new hires and proves very discouraging. If you do not sacrifice work/life balance in order to force yourself into opportunities within the company (not technical but managerial and sales) that can lead to growth you will be placed and forgotten. Growth in the company directly relates to how much time outside of your billed hours at a client you apply to the company which can be beneficial to younger single persons but if you have a family and a multi hour commute you might have difficulty proving your case for promotion.,"1.0

Used to have great people working there. They have left as the mentality of the company has changed.,"Sogeti's atmosphere and values have done a 180 degree pivot in the last few years. They used to emphasize fun and career opportunity. Now the company will chew you up and spit you out by over working you, assigning you to vampire clients that have no regard for people or their work life balance, giving little or no raise every year, and micromanaging you to no end. The company values money more than people as others have stated. There are some questionable to downright illegal things going on at some clients. Sogeti is gaining a sizeable team at some clients by slimy tactics and relationships with some people that they have planted as buyers at those clients. This is probably because they have stopped hiring good people and have little to offer the clients. The company is inflating their ratings on glassdoor by posting fake reviews. Most of the favorable reviews are company-produced. Take the negative reviews seriously. The company is cutting benefits as it struggles with legitimate sales, and is now effectively giving it's entire workforce a pay cut by imposing premiums for healthcare. That used to be a big selling point of the company - no premiums. Also, every year, the health insurance coverage quality is reduced by either increasing the deductible, or increasing the copay or the out-of-pocket maximums. The worst part is that the people in management are just unfriendly and they try to sell you on company policies as if you were stupid. Employees are lied to, promised bonuses and raises, but they never come, so people quit. This place is a revolving door of employees. Most of the people I worked with 4 years ago have left, and I felt like I was at a completely different company - in a bad way, so I left, just like they did.

Sogeti has an entrepreneurial spirt at local level with the organization structured at the city level, but it has tremendous power to delivery globally with a 180K employees world-wide. This allows employees to be decision makers and get involved while implementing fun and innovate solutions that can only be delivered by a large IT service provider and Sogeti’s relationship with Capgemini. Sogeti has a good balance between sales and delivery. The leadership team knows that good delivery is a key to long customer relationships and they have made investments in the last 2 years to standardize delivery and sales processes through their pursuit certification and engagement manager certification processes. There is a clear career path at Sogeti and the requirements for advancement are clear and objective. Consultants willing to spend a little time outside of their client serving work are rewarded. As with any consulting career, you can quickly develop a professional network with Sogeti. The benefit Sogeti brings is that you can build a deep local network in your market without having to travel across the country.","The onus of career management is squarely on the individual consultant at Sogeti. This can be difficult for many consultants who need a little push. ultants with good ideas are free to implement them, but it can be difficult to get executive level sponsorship and support. Due to the emphasis on local consulting, niche skills or senior level technical abilities are difficult to retain since the demand for those skills needs to be at the local level. You need to be flexible to work at Sogeti if you have a niche skill that may not be in constant demand in your market.","5.0

I'm in the Phoenix unit, and we have amazing support from our Account Executives, Leadership, and practice managers. It's also great to be a consultant and not have to be on the road all the time (locally based clients, as opposed to other large consulting gigs where you travel each week). Sogeti has great benefits, we have a great health insurance that used to be free premiums (2017 we will have to pay a small premium), great tuition reimbursement policy, and a solid 401k match (Sogeti matches $1.50 for every $1 you invest; it is fully vested after 3 years, up to 6% of base salary), plus a pretty reasonable bonus structure Aside from the unit, I can say a lot of how your experience is depends on what you make of it. My current engagement is amazing, as the account executive and onsite manager have been working very hard to develop a solid relationship with our client. Because of this, we have a lot of awesome opportunities and a pretty easy going experience with the client employees. They feel our support and don't feel threatened by us being there. There's tons of assistance in getting certifications, and typically Sogeti will reimburse most of the fees, because they get more skilled & certified consultants to sell to their clients, and you as the consultant get chances to further your education. Its a win-win for the company & its consultants. Plus the clients get better resources to help them with their work.","would be its tough to feel tied into your unit when you're in small teams spread across the whole city. You have to make an effort to feel connected to your unit, which can be tough. Also, there's not a very firm hierarchy, so you typically do not have a supervisor watching over you all day.

No rhyme or reason how they are awarded. If you get one, you will get a letter in the mail sometime in late January with a flat dollar amount. You need to request an increase to be considered. If not awarded, you can appeal but the request will not be followed up on and you will never hear anything back. HR doesn't seem to have a plan. The convoluted bonus structure is changed annually - sometimes mid-year and is heavily focused on sales. Need to develop a plan and stick with it so employees can begin to understand it and know what to aim for. Health care is no longer free but this was unheard of so no surprise that we have to pay premiums but it is a high deductible plan - 6k for family before it even pays for a prescription.

Make sure you get a better than average salary when you join because raises don't happen much and you have to beg for them. The new leadership in the Chicago office is aloof and will tell you what you want to hear - a little bit like a used car dealer. There is no follow through on promises and people are treated as disposable resources. People are fired and no one is told why, but it is clear - it is all about money and not people. You are billable or you are let go. People are afraid to be on the bench. People are promised a bonus for doing extra work for the company beyond your billable work, but it never comes. Company is constantly changing policies that effect people's compensation, but they are not well explained or thought through. The end result is a net benefit for the company at a cost to the consultant base. Company will not pay for certifications expenses up front, but makes you pass the test before they will reimburse you. Make sure you can pass a test before you sign up for it, otherwise it is on you. The quality of the team has gone way down over the last 3 or so years. Lots of people quitting. Most of the best have picked up and moved on. Many of those (with a few exceptions) that remain are people that don't have the will or skills to find a new job. New employees leave a lot to be desired. Probably because the company doesn't pay well. There is not a lot of good new work coming in, so people are put to work at clients doing things that are not a good match for their skills.","1.0

Certifications and continuing education opportunities are encouraged year over year. Getting to work with different clients and projects at a local level is pretty exciting and helps advance your base skills knowledge. Being a global enterprise company, Sogeti still has the ability to adapt and implement flexible delivery models aligned with their local market strategies. Shows a strong commitment towards client satisfaction and long term partnerships. Sogeti is a very well respected consulting company with many awards and continues to stay on top of new technologies. Strong health and 401k retirement benefits. Sogeti has a great entry level College graduate program with a lot of activities during that 1st year. Counselor program is a unique concept and helpful.","Like most consulting company, you don't get to pick what client project you go on although you still get to learn new things and take advantage of the experience. Training and certifications need to be worked on after hours if you are on project 40 hours a week which can be a difficult to find the time to fit it in. It's good to adapt and meet the market needs but seems like the local and regional alignments change often. Three year vesting in the 401k is not so bad but you must be employed through the end of that 3rd year to get your payout. Employee turnover for whatever the reason is tends to be a downer.

I got several job offers, but I picked Sogeti because it was a consulting firm that had a large client base in Phoenix so their consultants didn't have to travel every week. Over time, it turned out to be the best decision of my career!! The main things that made me fall in love with Sogeti are: Learning: Sogeti offer trainings in all aspects of IT. And they encourage you to take trainings, and pay for you to take industry standard certifications. Also, being a consultant, when my project end I go to a new client. And that helped me learn how technology is being used in multiple companies is Phoenix. In addition, I have a mentor who is coaching me to get to the next level in my career. Growth opportunities: Being a global consulting firm, the growth opportunities are huge. And the most important thing for me is that there is no ""red tape"". If you deserve a role, and you are passionate about it, you will get a chance. Global presence: I like Phoenix but if I want to see other places I can transfer to any other 20+ offices in the US and anywhere in Europe. People & culture: Sogeti has a progressive culture. I met some of the smartest professionals in my career in Sogeti. Benefits: no-nonsense benefits. My family and I pay $0 to keep health insurance, and I use HSA to pay for deductibles and save on taxes. I got multiple certifications, all expenses paid by Sogeti. Our sick time and vacation time is combined in one bucket of hours, so if I don't get sick I can use that time for vacation. And Sogeti is matching 150% to my 401k!","ulting role is usually more challenging than working directly for a company.

You can definitely set your own career path and achieve your goals. 401K matching is about the best I've ever seen and often employees are given profit sharing through an added bump into our 401K accounts. The clients and projects are interesting and Sogeti works hard to support delivery. There is a strong focus on providing client delight and much talk is given around creating solutions over transactional, staff augmentation work.","Unfortunately, the great intentions do not always come to fruition in practice. They will take staff augmentation work to keep people billing, but it definitely takes away from the opportunity to do true consulting work. Decisions are made hastily at times and it feels like the kitchen keeps getting rearranged. There are a lot of short sighted decisions being made instead of lasting strategy implementation. The bonus structure is revamped every year, and they are quick to point out how much better it will be for the consultant, then a month or two later the bonus tiers are reset back to what it was originally and this is creating a great deal of frustration among the consultants. It also affects morale, as the bonus is strongly connected to billable rates which the consultant has no control over. The rates are negotiated by the Account Execs who make their money regardless. If you are put on a project that is in trouble, you are punished by working to fix it, because by the time you get there, the project is a financial loser and your bonus suffers. This is a deplorable way to deliver bonuses, and it sends a powerful message to the consultants that I do not think is intended. Further, the messaging around all of this is terrible. Lastly, vacation time is not aligned with career experience. When bringing in new managers/senior managers and higher, they start everyone with the same offering and one must build tenure within. This is a detractor for those that have already achieved more personal time off. It impacts work/life balance as well, as senior leadership is expected to maintain a fulltime set of duties and are also mandated to bill a set amount of hours on top of that. They only give 7 days for holidays and they do not float, so it makes it difficult to follow the client's schedule, and quite honestly, 7 days per year is bad anyway.","4.0

Bonus system is awful, convoluted, and don't expect your due bonus if you leave. They will actually pay you your bonus and then take it out of your bank account. In my mind, this is illegal and tantamount to stealing. This happened to me and I never gave them permission to remove funds from my bank account.

You have to learn the skill while doing the job, which makes it very stressful and inefficient. - Spread their resources too thin.

Get experience at different companies, while maintaining the same job.","Sogeti is not a true consulting company there are few to no projects, and all of the work is staff augmentation. As a consultant you will not get the experience and methodologies present at other consulting companies. Sogeti is a staff augmentation or resource company. The structure of the company is based on selling resources (staff augmentation), the bonus structure and advancement is based on this. A technical resource will not have opportunities to advance, get training, and get the high bonuses at Sogeti. The only people who have been at Sogeti long term are the sales people who did not come up the consulting track, HR reps who have no technical or consulting background, the back office workers who came in as front desk secretaries, and senior managers who are selling resources. Technical people, project managers, and business analysts leave in 3 years after they are vested in the 401k plan and get very poor raises during those years, once you get to know people there it is well known that raises are not given out. The projects you will work on are rarely cutting edge or large enterprise project, much of the work is maintenance and support. Clients are generally not impressed with Sogeti and are vocal about it. As a consultant you will not grow within Sogeti, or within the client, your growth will be limited to what you do outside of Sogeti. Most of the non-consultants: low level HR reps, back office workers, and sales people have offices with window views and are vastly under qualified for their job. No one outside of billing consultants have consulting experience, which creates a difficult environment for conversations regarding clients and projects. The non-consultants are treated like gold, while the consultants are treated like a depreciating product. Also if you are a consultant and your client has a day off, you have to use PTO, unfortunately clients have significantly more days off than Sogeti does so go ahead and knock several days off your PTO as you will be forced to use them. If you read the other favorable reviews they are written as though it is an advertisement and I believe they are fake as I just learned Sogeti monitors the reviews here. Be wary of those reviews as I have not met another person at Sogeti who is actually happy with their work or opportunities that is on the consulting side.","2.0

You need to voice your opinion strongly in order to get the type of jobs you want, but they are not guaranteed. Do not go into this job expecting a bonus. Sogeti recruiters will push the 20k+ bonus, but the bonus system is a nationwide tiered ranking for all consultants at every level and is not just performance based. Only top level consultants that work on contracts and lead practices will get the 10 and 20k+ bonuses. Typical bonus for most consultants is 5k but thats after a couple of years.

Fast forward - today the only  I would like to comment on is the 401(K) match which is on par with the industry standards, everything else has gone down","Lots of internal politics, worse the CEO and COO / VP of operations are related to each other - even though the management talks about an open door policy these 2 call the shots and rule with an iron fist i.e. threatening people, they talk about infusing fresh blood to the company to take it forward but they have to retire first before someone else can move in. Working culture resembles an Indian factory where everything is done by cracking the whip, in addition to that there are a lot of folks who have been given leadership roles without having the right kind of experience. For instance the COO has never sold IT Services, not a financial guy neither has a HR background - is an Oracle Apps person and yet he is now at the helm of running the company - there are branch managers who have never been people's managers and are now running P & L's resulting in high attrition. Company is no longer growing, hence there are no new clients - consultants no longer get to work on newer technologies, training & development is out of question because one can't afford not to bill, all of this makes it difficult to bring in the right talent to the company when building a practice. It seems that we always talk about Solutioning and practices but end up doing staff augmentation. The Parent company really no longer cares about what goes on with Sogeti USA and may be it is time for them to do a reality check and do may be recommend a change in overall leadership.","2.0

No copay health Insurance, HSA decent vacation time, mileage reimbursement.","401K hidden gems (Company wont tell you). 1) If you are new to the company you don't get the profit sharing, 2) 3 years vesting plan 3) The match is paid in full once a year at the end of December ( this is not only terrible is almost immoral for people that need to leave the company for what ever reason, not to mention as a Financial move is bad to place 1 huge amount of money in 1 deposit what is the stock price is too high ? then you lose money on top of all the drama.) 4) The profit sharing was less than promise in 2013. 5) The company bets that if they distribute the 401K money they will stop the attrition but a lot of people will leave at the same time after they deposit the money. High deductible plan per family is insanely high and its much higher than other companies $6500. They will move from Aetna PPO to United health care in 2014 and they do not include vision and primary physician annual check up , now will be one or the other so you have to chose between you physical or your eyes and Rx glasses reimbursement is over as with Aetna you get up to 150 dollars reimbursement. Bonus: OMG you have to kiss all management boots to get a small bonus, even if you were billable all year if your profit is not high you are screw. Instead of changing you clients to help out with your billing they let you with your client till death. (No bonus for me this year) Don't even start me with overtime the CEO keeps stealing the good things remaining in the company and he always do it in 2 or 3 steps ( two or three years in the making of this scam) so people don't immediately understand they being fool and steal them a huge benefit in the company. He removed all Comp time and rename it to something else ( this trick is something people in marketing use to change the vision of the people with bad companies like BP or Chevron ) then the next year change the rules on the new program so you can't accrued time unless you are 96% productive (1880 hours) , then he next year changes again saying you need to be 96% productive and what ever you do for overtime now will convert to points for bonus ( this is a huge cheap trick ) it translate you might not have a bonus and the company will make more profit in your behalf for your time and effort and wont even reward you with vacation time. Another great thing lost again steal from us is the Employee of the week gift !! This was a huge deal Things they gave me cameras, then gps's later ipod then open choice electronic reimbursement up to $100 dollars then Boss headphones and this 2013 (drums )..... NOTHING !! He said will give us a free day on 12/31 instead. I beat my car that in 2014 he will remove 12/31 as holiday and boom he disappear another benefit. So you get the idea how things are , if something is good wait 15 min. he will change it again to save a buck on your behalf so he can get another bigger bonus.","2.0

So if you leave prior to this date, you don't get a match for that year 5) You use to get Comp Time for any hours worked over 40 in a week. Now, you have to work 47 Weeks (1880 hours) worth of billable hours for Comp Time to accrue and if you dig deeper, this effectively removes Comp Time 6) Recently, they implemented a policy that new hires get laptops with very limited permissions. So if you have to use your laptop at a client, be prepared to be on the phone with help desk, trying to get basic software installed 7) Many of the Account Executives are just salesman and really could care less about you and only care that you are at one of their accounts making money for them. Some can be very unethical as well. 8) If your client is closed and Sogeti is not, you must take PTO. Even if you want to hit the bench, you will not be able too, unless granted special permission 9) If you have a long commute to a client, they only pay .35 cents for mileage, if they cannot bill it to the client 10) Their HR System (Time, Expenses, PTO Monitoring etc etc) is one of the worst systems I have ever encountered. 11) Bonus is heavily tied to sales and your billing rate, which often times, you have no control over 12) You can get stuck doing Staff Aug for years at a client 13) You can have a known track record for upsetting clients and being kicked off engagements but as long as you are visible in the office, you can not only keep your job but get promoted as well, I saw this a few times","3.0

They are much more similar to, say, TEKsystems or KForce than to, say, CapGemini or Accenture in that they make their profit by renting out their staff -- usually programmers -- to client firms. Sadly, they will often try to fit a square peg in a round hole. During my tenure, for example, I saw a Java programmer being rented out as a Business Analyst.","2.0

Fri Apr 13 2012 05:15:15 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Cincinnati, OH","Senior Consultant in Cincinnati, OH",Good career route for IT professionals,I have been working at Sogeti,"If your career path is in IT, then consulting with Sogeti provides a good opportunity to learn more competitive IT skills while working at Fortune 500 clients. Sogeti works with the largest companies and provides employees with reasonable opportunities to gain experience and increase in responsibility. The talent level varies, but overall most Sogeti consultants are competent and good at working together. For recent college graduates or IT professionals early in your career, Sogeti would be a great place to start and build your experience. It may also be a good fit for IT professionals that are at the point in their career where quality of life is more important than career advancement. Generally, Sogeti consulting is a 40 hour a week job with reasonable pay and benefits.","Pay is average and does not necessary increase regularly through the base salary. Sogeti pay increases come through bonuses that competitively sought after. Although there are a number of quantitative factors considered, the subjective aspects from management generally are the deciding factors in whether you get a bonus. Sogeti runs a lean operation to keep their billable rates competitive, so that affects both salary potential and employee support services. Employee development is below average because of this approach to cost management.","4.0

Thu Apr 12 2012 09:58:41 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Columbus, OH","Manager Consultant in Columbus, OH","Sales Focused, No Overtime, Large Company. Right for some, but not all.",I have been working at Sogeti,"I agree with all the other pros mentioned by other posters. I would like to echo that there are many good consultants that work for Sogeti, but over the years I have seen the best of the best leave for other consultant companies who are more employee focused. Sogeti is very sales driving in everything they do. Bonuses are not based on your technical expertise but instead how much money you bill clients. Training is talked about, but if you leave the client to training you are penalized in multiple ways. Certifications are paid for, but you need to expense them and that negatively impacts your bonus. The biggest pro with organization benefits is 6% 401K matching and profit sharing bonus up to 5%. The biggest pro in regards to work is that they are a very large company and can get into bigger companies that smaller consulting companies can't touch. So there is potential to work your way to very good lead positions if you are driven. You can't get that with small consultant companies. If you are driven and want to lead projects and team, go Sogeti. If you are technology driven, then you got something to think about.","My main gripe right now is that Sogeti has altered their overtime policy in such a way that it is much harder to get credit for any overtime you work. The CEO and HR say in not so many words that reducing our overtime benefits (called comp time) is to help us. It is not that Sogeti no longer provides overtime benefits. Sogeti does offer them, but they put in place rules to make it hard to earn them. Despite numerous complaints HR is non responsive. Why do they not pay overtime? Because we are doing a lot of fixed bid projects and they don't want to risk having to pay consultants to much money. And if we are doing time and material work the company would like to pocket any overtime we bill and not pay us for it. All about the PNL.","3.0

They hire people straight out school, so if you are under qualified it is a great place to start.","- They have a ""you owe the company"" approach to managment - Managment has no real focus people, on hitting sales goals - Pay to bill rate ratio is vastly out of line with national averages - FTE/W2/IC clasifications are blurry, poorly documented, and based mostly on localized managment - Have no backbone with clients and pass changes in contracts directly to employees - Have an undocumented expense policy and routinely pay expenses 4 - 8 weeks after incurred - 90% of back office and managment are H1 Visa with poor communication skills and have no critical thinking ability - Ran like a government bueracracy - Unethical, billing practices are underhanded - Offshore model is horrible and terms are not flexible, Cognizant kicks there butt every time on price, quality, and availability - The only way to get rewarded is based on the amount of money they make from you being at client - They change benefits and policies without communicating - They use the single most difficult time collection tool every made In the 20 years I have worked in this industry, not one firm has been worse. Since the outsourcing to India boom started I have seen and worked with many off shore teams. It is very obvious that this company is owned and operated from and by resources from India. They think they are better than everyone else, that they add some value that does not exist, and refuse to accept that basically they are just the cheapest guys in town. They have major ethics issues which spawn every facet of the organization from finance to human resources to sales. They fail to meet goals on fixed bid engaments and sell clients on a track record of success that does not exist. The claim to have expetise and experience in markets and SME that are false or created with no backing.","1.0

This is a consulitng firm so you must pilot your own career - no one will do this for you. In upper levels, they do expect you to help sell so this will keep me from pursuing a promotion. They have had to make some difficult decisions concerning layoffs recently - never an easy thing to do and the process will always make someone unhappy. Main thing to remember is this is primarily a sales organization and is run as one. If you are not comfortable with expanding your skills to get on a gig then you will not be comfortable here.","4.0
