For GIS people, Esri is ground zero. The Redlands campus has the highest concentration of GIS intelligence on the planet. But it's also a global company with a footprint in virtually every country in the world. This is a smart, fun, interesting, and interested collection of people. ArcGIS products set the industry standards literally. If you've got the skills and like to work hard, the pay can be quite good. Not Silicon Valley level pay, but pretty darn good and getting more competitive. Cost of living in Redlands is half of Santa Clara, if that. Redlands is a nice little town, detached enough from the So Cal megalopolis to feel separate. Palm Springs, mountains, beaches all close by. The COVID situation has proven that this company cares about employees. We have actually pivoted beautifully to remote work. Jack and Laura Dangermond are titans of the tech world, but also conservationists (look up Dangermond Preserve). One last thing: this place is financially rock solid. In an age of venture capital and fly-by-night startups, this company is privately held, has zero debt, and growing steadily for decades into a multi-billion dollar concern. Business schools should study how this place is run.","Upper management is well entrenched, which is only a con for middle managers trying to break into the inner circle.","5.0

A positive experience can be had, but depends heavily on your manager and team.","The negative reviews about the old guard are completely true. The culture at Esri can be outright toxic and hostile. While there are some truly amazing and inspiring people that work here, they are quickly drowned out by those that are manipulative and completely self-serving. If you are considering working here then know that HR at Esri DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS. They truly are there to only represent the company, and care very little about mitigating or representing anything you may be concerned about. They will not get involved at all to try to improve things, but play defense only. It is not impossible to have a positive experience here, but you may find yourself wondering why it should be so hard to do so. Just remember to be careful with who you trust, and question everything that you're told about how the work gets done.","1.0

During your first week of training, they mention if you are in this position for more than a few years you will get burnt out, which is true.

If you’re lucky and you get in the “right” group or department, you can skate by, doing the minimum, for years with little or no stress","March 17, 2020 and the most of California (if not the U.S. and the world) is on lock-down due to Covid-19 yet my former colleagues at Esri are still required to report to the office. Inexplicable and irresponsible. There is one reason and one reason only. The need for complete control by senior leadership (ie, the owners). It comes down to their antiquated hourly pay structure. They believe you can’t be trusted to honestly report your time unless they can see you, unless, of course, you’re a chosen one who’s allowed to work from home in Colorado or Arizona, etc. Yet countless employees charge 10-12 hours/day with 3-4 hours of actual productivity and apparently that’s fine by them. This type of employee comes in two flavors, depending on their manager. Those with strict management, sit tied to their desk, usually eating lunch at their desk, because if they actually go out, they’re not getting paid. And they must work at least 9 hours/day to get an “equivalent” salary (pssss it’s 2020, get with the times). On the other hand, there are managers who don’t pay attention (often because they have 20+ direct reports or they no incentive to care). Their employees can take long lunches, come and go throughout the day, nap in their car (or even at home if they live close enough), run their side businesses, go to the casino (true example) – all paid by Esri. Productivity is extremely low yet Jack’s answer to every problem is “hire more engineers”. I’ve worked at a number of companies, large and small and Esri is unique, to put it nicely. The company’s policies and procedures are a joke, if they even exist. Security is not administered very well. HR is not allowed to perform many of their intended functions and are often adversarial to the employee rather than a resource. Redlands is scorching in the summer and boring year-round. In its attempt to be everything to every potential customer, the company is falling behind other, cheaper alternatives. Oh yeah. Salespeople are not incentivized to sell. Seriously. A 3% 401k match is a joke. No cash bonus is unheard of in this industry. At my current company, I can pretty much work when and from where I choose. Because I’m trusted and held accountable to perform my job. Foreign concepts at Esri. I’m rambling now.","1.0

When I started around three and a half years ago my team was one of the very first to be using git. Everyone else was still using starteam. Testing (except for throwing code over the fence at some poor sucker) and ci/cd are almost unheard of. There are also a lot of office politics, and a definite “old boys club.” Finally, getting help or resources from teams outside of your own (and often, even on your own team) is like pulling teeth. It felt like engineers completely ignored my requests or questions until I had demonstrated that I wasn’t an idiot and earned some social capital. Now imagine that you’re working on something that needs to work with Pro, ArcGIS online, the latest version of server, and the sdks. Good luck getting any of the engineers on teams other than your own to share knowledge. As a result, everyone does things their own way and integrating the “platform” involves lots and lots of duck tape and prayer.","2.0

The HR team looks out for the companies best interest and is not in support of the individuals within Esri at all. No matter the situation or disagreement, HR will always be in support for the company plain and simple. - Growth is not supported or discussed. If you apply to Esri, depending on which team, be prepared to have that role for years with no change to your pay what so ever. - If you are looking for a possible financial opportunity, Esri is not the company for you. There are ""yearly increases"" that come at Esri, however if you team did not perform, or your manager made poor decision, your team will not see an increase. If that .50 cents is important to you however, you may make an argument as to why you deserve it while sitting with your manager and HR. - Esri will promote individuals based off years served at Esri and not based off experience. You can see someone being promoted to Marketing Director who's spend 15 years at Esri as an Engineer rather than promoting a 5 year Marketing Manger to Marketing Director.

Too many employees as compared to the work delivered - many of them are poorly managed and do not contribute fairly to the company’s growth.. Staff over 15-20 years with Esri, barely come to work or deliver anything, but stay employed for the benefits and to get a salary, and this affects the wage budgets for other staff who actually do the work. There are too many managers who barely move out of roles and so the flat structure translates to little or no growth for other staff. Although, if you are related to a director/manager, or are a ‘favorite’, you’ll go places without really working. HR is painfully slow and incompetent, biased (pro-management) and hence, unapproachable. We lose more staff than we hire because HR doesn’t have a Retention Unit to work with resigning staff, then they lose time and money replacing valuable staff. Redlands was cheap in 60-70s, not anymore, but the pay scales haven’t increased proportionately and the annual increments are minuscule if not, unfair and even insulting at times!","2.0

Mon Dec 31 2018 09:38:49 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time), Software Engineer,"Redlands, CA",Former Employee ,Great coworkers. Nice environment. Not-so-great management,I worked at Esri full-time for more than 5 years,"(I can only speak for the department I worked at, each department can be different) - Esri is an extremely multi-cultural place to work at. People come from all around the world and most are very nice and try to make some friends, so it is easy to have some good friendship here. - Work life balance is good. In some departments/teams there is work-from-home policy, and work hour can be very flexible. It's good for those who have kids or other duties to take care of during the day. - Because Esri is the biggest ""GIS shop"" in the world, it was easy to work with customers from all kinds of backgrounds and to see all sorts of interesting projects. Esri's User Conference has over 15K attendees each year and it was very mind-blowing to see/listen to how users apply Esri's technologies to solve their problems. It made me feel proud to work at Esri. - The Esri headquarter is a very beautiful campus, and Redlands itself is a nice place to live and start a family. The town itself is historical and has some of the best schools for kids, and is just 1-hours away from LA, and 1-hour away from the mountain area where people can go hiking, skiing, rock-climbing and mountain-biking . - Unlike some people who think the compensation is much lower compared to other places, the overall compensation package is actually not bad and it can support a decent living in Redlands. Esri also provides extremely good benefits (visa sponsorship, 401K matching, insurance, FSA, onsite gym room, onsite bike storage room, etc.) --- Another reason to settle down and start a family in Redlands.","(Again I am only speaking for the department I worked at) - Since the job environment is stable, it's not uncommon to see those who are under-productive (or not see them because most of the time they're not in office). Even worse, there are some team leads who have been here long enough who think they are the authority of everything. A lot of additional team processes are added just to make these leads happy, and these processes can change from time to time depending on when they change their mind. - Esri has an annual review system in place, and it requires employees to set goals each year. But this is just the hardware! Changing job roles/team is extremely difficult even although you work really hard to prove yourself. Some managers set up regular meetings with individual team members (which is a good thing), but these conversation do not help unless you want to move to the direction that they want. Some conversations can even lead you to think it's your fault not doing a good enough job to earn the opportunity (I blamed it mostly on the lead/manager, not Esri). This is the main reason I chose to leave Esri. - Teams try to run software development process, but it's not uncommon to see big code changes/last minute check-in happening after code freeze. Sometimes changes can happen without team members being notified. This is a disrespect to the team but what's worse is the quality of the software can be hurt. Also, some teams do not value design and/or QA process. Some people just rush through software development and then hand over the software to QA who have no ideas how things are expected to work. - Esri has a very flat organizational structure --- this is a double-edged sword and doesn't necessarily lead you to opportunities to try out different things or pursue career passion. Having a flat structure means you might be pulled into the tasks you like or you hate. And because most people have the same title, you really have to learn the company's politics to know who to talk to to sort out different things. - When I started a few years ago, the entire orientation was a half-a-day activity which only covered the HR stuff, and I had little idea about how Esri's technologies work and how users use them. Given that Esri builds so many products, I really hope that the company has improved to give new employees a more detailed introduction on how things work together. - Many tech shops nowadays provide perks like free lunch, free snacks, beer, game room, massage sessions, even onsite barristers. Esri does have fancy coffee machines all over the campus, a gym room, and a free Christmas breakfast every year, and the company probably doesn't need these perks to attract the ""GIS-geeks"" to apply and join, but moving forward it's time to considering adding some of these to boost employees' happiness.","3.0

First and foremost, co-workers can be really cool, or really annoying. Decent food at the Cafe although expensive for the most part. The technology stack is pretty good... but very few people know how to use it and its been pretty much ignored by several large depts. With that said, see the cons below:","There is a lot of dead weight here. People are NOT held accountable for poor performance, lack of knowledge or wasting of money. In my position, we do not have enough staff to support the workload, although they continue to jam a ton of work down our throats without any thought or care. We get contactors here and there and ESRI makes it very hard to roll them into a full a time job. We have lost some amazingly talented contractors because of how HR and MGT deals with onboarding. Oddly enough, this will depend on the dept and building you work in. There is a ton of drama and re-orgs happening around here. Oh and their favorite word seems to be ""value add"", however those words are meaningless if you are a manager. We are seeing a lot of employees with 5-15 years, leaving the company. You will see HR on glassdoor run interference with replies when it comes to supporting career growth. The truth is, you may get a title, but you will NOT be paid accordingly. How is that supporting career growth? Its complete and utter BS. Communication with HR and MGT is poor, to say the least. Most people end up doing a job they do not want and absorb more reponsibily without compensation. I too have been a victim of a position change that stalled and went no where, without any explanation no matter how many times i have asked. For that very reason, i have begun sending my resume out and will be getting out of here. Employeees are required to work 45 hrs a week. That 5 hrs is not time and a half, nor is any overtime time and a half. How they have been getting away with this, is beyond me. Class action anyone? There is also a most elite culture here because they are tied to academia through the Unv of Redlands. The reality of ESRI culture is that its a huge liberal bubble over the city of Redlands with crazy speak of climate change, anti conservative views and politically hidden agendas. The company does very little for employees here and slaps the success of the business in our faces by donating 150+ million dollars for a nature reserve under the owners names, not under the company name. I guess they forget where the success has originated from, but hey, that's liberals for you. Employees are not given anything back for the success of the business, yet ESRI cant figure out why people are leaving... Interestingly enough, for the amount of tech at this location, the pay is about 30% below market value for being in the deadlands. There is way too many re-orgs, position changes and just utter drama between medium to upper level management. HR is there in the interest of the business. Oh and before i forget, those of you who will be going through the hiring process here, enjoy your full day of interviews with meaningless managers who are totally irrelevent of what you're going to be hired for. 13 interviews are common, with a stop by the corporate office for your last interview if you're successful. There are a lot of unprofessional managers here, with the majority being found with the M, Q and L buildings. Currently, there is too much drama occurring with the L building itself with a huge shakeup on level 3.","2.0

Accepting the CSR job was a step back but since I’ve heard nothing but great feedback about the company I was excited to have the opportunity to work there. But now I am so perplexed about how the Customer Service department lacks so much. It was a waste of my time. The CSR job title is not appropriate based on the roles and expectations of the position. Process steps are verbally given and you’re expected to know the steps based on memory. “Step by step instructions make the policy and procedures too lengthy“ - words from a manager. There are many complexities to the position and not enough support. You’re not given enough repetitive items nor dedicated time to solidify knowledge of what you’re taught before being trained on another complex aspect of the position. No cheat sheets and reference materials are not cohesive. Errors are listed in bold text in order notes that anyone in the department can see and highlighted in red text on a shared spreadsheet. And you are marked for errors that you’ve never been trained on. The trainers (2 for the entire department of 50+) would rather you submit questions in email because their too busy to work with you side by side. Many times for 1-2 hours a day, I had nothing to do and no one checking on me. Training takes anywhere from 2-4 months!? No wonder it’s so long, there’s so much time being unproductive. There’s no positive reinforcement and newbies are told to make their own notes for learning. The training is unstructured and clearly lacks an outlined training program.","1.0

Reading that esri is making top lists for happy staff is a joke. Ask the staff, that is not the setimate. Being told benefits are paid for so its a great company to work for is no longer relevant. Costs of living continue to rise with salaries staying so low many non exempt staff are having to work two jobs just to make ends meet. Human Resource department is extremely inefficient and quite frankly rude with a secret society attitude. They do nothing to assist employees with complaints. Working as non-exempt staff is like being second class here. Its assumed your not worth anything compared to exempt. With no advancement in carreers here also, EVERYTHING IS CONSIDERED LATERAL.

Because incompetence goes unpunished, incompetents abound. Lower-than-average pay and vacation time. Negotiate before signing anything. Some colleagues are refreshingly diligent and professional, while others distinguish themselves by spending hours (no exaggeration) chatting about matters other than work and disappearing for two hours daily. A ""strict"" ""policy"" forbidding working from home means that, depending on your department and manager, you can either work from home regularly or never work from home. Combine that with being paid by the hour, and the result is colleagues spending hours chatting about matters other than work and taking multi-hour breaks. This technology company uses two timekeeping systems that do not communicate with each other. You enter your hours in both, and managers spend their time reconciling the two.","2.0

The work-life balance is also good, and almost all employees are paid hourly so that your time is compensated appropriately. The benefits at Esri are also top-notch: all premiums for medical insurance are paid by the company and the insurance plans are some of the best out there (very low deductibles and allows you to choose your health care practitioner); 401(k) matching is modest, but Esri's contribution to retirement plans are supplemented with generous profit-sharing to-boot (so it all evens-out at the end of the day), and the fund selection is generally pretty good.","Compensation (base salary in particular) could be better when compared to the industry as a whole, especially since no stock-options are available as Esri is privately-owned. This is mitigated somewhat by profit-sharing and the excellent benefits, but even so the numbers are no better than slightly above-median pay. Don't apply thinking you'll be offered a compensation package anything comparable from that of a silicon-valley tech-giant or NY fin-tech firm.","4.0

Yes, we are in business to make money, however we have a real vested interest in our users - the two are not mutually exclusive. The sales organization is made up of people that truly care for the users and want the best for them, perhaps because there is no real incentive to force sales since our organization is commission-free. There is a lot of talent at Esri and it's a privilege to work among so many brilliant people. Esri offers great benefits - health coverage can be especially valuable to large families and I genuinely think this keeps a lot of our workers with young families around. Folks who work on Redlands campus get to indulge in a Café, gym, regular social events, and other fun interactive engagements that foster a sense of community.","Compensation seems adequate for technical staff, but we aren't allowed to discuss rates with one another so it's hard to know whether there is room to improve. Raises are modest to minimal. Profit sharing is put into 401k whether we like that or not, although to be fair 401k loans are allowed. The organization is growing and with that come growing pains - communication suffers most. There's a weird mix of off-putting overproduced videos of management selling concepts to us in some areas and crickets in other areas. What communication there is, tends to be near-term and doesn't allow a lot of prep time to help us help customers understand changes that impact them. Talented people are overloaded with hundreds of customers or piles of complex work while less competent staff are allowed to get by doing very little. Some divisions have too much process, others too little. Remote managers are becoming ever more common so you may find yourself reporting and rating to someone you seldom see in person. If you work in a Regional Office and don't want to move to HQ, career opportunities can be limited. Regional Offices don't enjoy as many perks as people employed at HQ. Policies and inflexibility cause managers to spend too much time running interference on approvals that aren't worth their time rather than mentoring those who need it. The company is privately held by older persons who have not communicated what will happen to it when they retire.","4.0

Lots of opportunities for improving your technology skills. They use state of the art business software, such as Lync for videoconferencing.","Business development realigns frequently due to changes in the market. There is poor communication from the top when the organization realigns. This also means you have to be okay with your team and sometimes your manager constantly changing. Some managers do things last minute, which causes staff to have to scramble and work late to meet a deadline or prepare a presentation. Overtime is not easily approved for admins. Admins are expected to work from 8 to 5 and are not allowed to work from home. This is a pro as long as you can get your job done during regular business hours. If it is a busy time of year, the pressure is on the admin. Admins don't get paid when the office closes due to inclement weather because they cannot work from home. They can ""get paid"" if they use their PPL during closures. This matters more in the regional offices where it snows. Admins don't have good opportunities for job advancement. There is no flextime for admins, so if you need to leave early one day you can't make it up another day. Business software changes and you have to learn on the job, so you have to be the type of admin who can teach yourself new software.","3.0

Free medical benefits for employee and family.,"Employees are promoted based on friendship with managers, being married to an employee, or being there the longest. It does not seem like their ability to manage others is ever evaluated. Many managers are lawsuits waiting to happen. Employees are not held to the same standards and favoritism is very common. One 15+ year employee is not allowed to work from home even one day a week, while a coworker gets to ‘work from home’ and take long weekends. An employee was allowed to move out of state and work remotely, while others in the same role are told no. In order to change roles you need your manager's approval, who is usually the person/reason you want to leave. They can stop your ability to transfer and so people end up leaving.

Most people in marketing do just that. They learned it from watching the department headband managers.","Leadership is so busy with fighting each other that you rarely are given clear direction. Forget about coaching, mentorship, or career advancement. None of that happens at Esri. Each of the ""middle managers"" in marketing are mediocre at best, but will not admit their shortcomings. A few of them even lied on their resumes in order to get hired! They spend all day in meetings and answering emails. Marketing leadership tries to let its workers know everything is ok by having second-rate all hands meetings, but they are all for the purpose of stroking the CMO's ego. If you are passive-aggressive and love to tell people what they are not good enough to do, you will love this place. Industry solutions is no better - they are full of male chauvinists. They serve no real value other than schmoozing at trade show.","1.0

The amount of sick leave provided (5 days per year) is actually below the new California minimum (as of July 1, 2015), and is only legal due to a grandfather clause. Furthermore, Esri offers zero paid parental leave. Once you've exhausted your (paltry) vacation and sick leave, you'll have to rely on the government for financial assistance, if you live in California (not all Esri employees do). Did I mention you can't accrue more than 10 days of sick leave?

Honestly... it was a WONDERFUL place to work but not anymore. Since the founder and CEO (Jack Dangermond) is easing towards retirement, there is a power grab among the legacy managers (Directors). In the past few years really good people have either left on their own or been forced out by this tier of management that had practically no previous management experience before Esri. I encourage you to take a look at the resumes for the senior leadership at Esri and you'll find a bunch of 40-50 white males that have no management experience outside of Esri. Their lack of non-Esri management experience is evident in how they manage employees. Unless you're a ""buddy"" of one of these managers, be prepared to be motivated by intimidation and performance threats. It's comical when one these legacy managers leave Esri for a management position at a different company. Their incompetence is quickly identified as undesirable and they flame out in a matter of months and are back at Esri in a different management position within a year or two.

Fri Sep 18 2015 08:44:16 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Executive ,Executive,I worked at Esri,"Jack Dangermond is one of the founders of the GIS Industry. His vision in regards to the application of Geography, and related sciences, to give a spatial context to analyzing and solving problems is something worth working for. Jack has been expressing this vision in an extremely consistent way for many years. Using the geographic advantage to better understand problems, analyze alternative, and implement solutions is nothing short of brilliant. GIS is a relatively narrow niche, but it has the ability of being part of practically every other industry in the world. This potential is also worth working for.","Unfortunately, however, that vision worth working for is being completely counteracted by extremely poor administrative and dismal management practices: 1) Esri's management people, at all levels, have attained their positions through relative success, but are not trained and have no understanding of management practices. All too often you have people who are bright technicians but dismal managers and their management style is inherited from above into establishing an environment of fear and retribution. Many of these managers have attained their positions through back-stabbing and trampling over other people, thus ""demonstrating"" that they are better than anyone else. This culture of management-incompetent people being allowed to become managers is probably the worst con at Esri. If you are an employee, or are considering becoming part of Esri, be prepared to work with a field full of snakes-in-tall-grass. 2) The focus of Esri used to be on the Customer. In fact, many organizations became engaged with Esri because that that outward locus of control. Recently, however, that locus has become more internal and it has become clear that while they say that customer relations are still number one, the reality is that their current interest are more mundane and self-centered. The focus now is on making ""the sale"". How that is accomplished is not relevant. Everyone at Esri now finds themselves reporting to an ever changing tide of managers and supervisors all with their own individual agendas and purposes but always with the ultimate goal of closing a deal. It is not uncommon to have review meetings at all levels with multiple overseers where the primary goal is to make their target feel inadequate. 3) The management of Human Resources is utterly non-sense. People are hired and put to work with zero on-boarding and support. New hires are expected to learn their jobs by the seat of their pants, become instant experts, and no one will lift a finger to help you understand what is expected of you. There are no definition of duties or responsibilities, managers do not clearly articulate expectations and do not set criteria, other than a joke of an Employee Performance Management System that is implemented with less care and consistency than an afterthought. Ultimately some people are rewarded and promoted because they are amiable or because they demonstrated that they are ""better"" than anyone else, while others are alienated and set aside, devoid of opportunity or standing because they did not meet some unspoken and unknown expectation. 4) The product line at Esri has always being complicated and cumbersome. That was particularly true when the software was command line-driven, but even today, with all the advancements of modern computing, becoming proficient in the use of their products requires a life-time commitment. Not only are their products cumbersome and complicated to use, but their product line is so extensive and convoluted that no one, not even Esri's experts, fully understand it. This causes an environment of confusion, duplication, and and overabundance of solutions where 90% of functionality is never really used by customers. It is a full time effort just to understand the product line and keep up with its ever changing iterations and levels of implementations. Never mind trying to explain what Esri does to your friends at a cocktail party. 5) Performance at Esri used to be measured by how well the client's needs were being met. Today, performance at Esri is measured by a mountain of ever changing procedures, methodologies, practices, and subjective directives. One day is different than the next, but the focus is on the process not the outcome. Thousands of man-hours are wasted every year in ridiculous meetings where everyone frets over the use of one word versus another or whether or not a description is succinct enough to meet some ever changing unknown expectation. The use of SalesForce, while promoted as being a tool to help capture and manage customer interactions, is really a means for these poor excuses for managers to impose their inconsistent point of view through overbearing coaching. In short, Esri used to be a place worth working at, but as of late, you'll find that many many people have left because they cannot stand the disappointment any longer. It will take more than pseudo re-organizations and shuffling of the same bad managers from one place to another to make Esri a place where people can see themselves working the rest of their lives. In the meantime, they'll continue to fully occupy their narrow niche, hire and disappoint people and carry on trying to make the next sale. Good luck!","1.0

Esri provides their clients the tools and services they need to make the world a better place . It doesn't matter whether you're into solving world hunger, protecting the environment, or preserving our crumbling infrastructure. Esri has tools and services that make it easier. At Esri you get to work with some of the world's most brilliant minds; people who are passionate about what they do. You can have access to cutting edge software and will be empowered to do what you need to in order to get the job done, so long as you are putting the customer first. If you are unsure of which path to take you only need ask yourself two questions; is it ethical? and is it good for the customer? If the answer is yes to both, there will likely be no serious repercussions if you make a mistake.","If you're looking for high wages and a lot of recognition, Esri's culture will work against you. Some folks at Esri are making good money and some are in the spotlight. These are not necessarily the same people. If it's the spotlight you want, you have to be a true believer and an evangelist. If it's high pay you're looking for, you need to grind, grind, grind. Oftentimes these goals are mutually exclusive. The expectation is that the work is its own reward. What that translates to in real life is that strong performers are held accountable and poor performers are not. This upside down model can create a caustic work environment, especially when poor performers are promoted out of their groups (sometimes the easiest way to get rid of a problem is to promote it away) while good performers are treated like traitors if they express a desire to advance their careers.","4.0

My mindset became why work my butt off if there is no room for advancement. I saw employees obtain their MBA's and management continued to hold them back and not advance them. 90% of the time Esri will hire from the outside before they will advance a current employee. Employees are not groomed for advancement. Esri is not pro families. They host no functions that would include employees and thier families. They don't do any functions through the year for the employees. These are the things that help employee moral. The companies mindset is the employee should be exceedingly overjoyed just for working at Esri that the company doesn't need to do a darn thing to show appreciation to thier employee's. Top management just doesn't get that part. Communication does not happen at Esri. Things I needed to do my job, was like pulling teeth to get information. Esri is so ""team"" oriented yet communion is not there. So, to summarize, if you are thinking of going to work for Esri and you manage to get through thier growling interview process, go in with the mindset that Esri will only be your springboard to go out and find your dream job with a company that shows they truly care about thier employee's.","2.0

Tue Mar 10 2015 11:22:06 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,,Management ,"Typical corporate scheme, sad people abundant, and Redlands is located in the middle of the desert.",I worked at Esri,"The best thing that Esri did for me was teach me what I don't want to do with the rest of my life. So thank you Esri! Best of luck to you all in the dry desert! I always thought it was funny that Google Maps colored the rivers blue where they trailed through Redlands on the map, because those rivers definitely don't have any water. The Esri ""campus"" has an abundant assortment of vegetation to keep you shaded, but of course the offset is an unnecessary hydrological burden on the local water supply. So much for being an environmental company. Also at Esri, you'll have the joy of being surrounded by many other transplants just like yourself, most of whom left their extended families thousands of miles behind to develop this so-called business career. Esri is grateful. Esri will fly you to all sorts of conferences, so that you can convince people that they, too, need GIS, even if you convince them to buy things that they clearly don't need or understand. If they have a checkbook and a pen, then you have a reason to talk with them. Esri sells to just about anybody and works with distributors all over the planet to sell its software. You will definitely sharpen your corporate skills at this company, but keep in mind that Pink Floyd wrote a marvelous song called ""Dogs"" just to clarify the truth behind corporate lifestyle. But you do get a decent benefits package; although you're not vested (meaning, able to keep your company matched 401K contribution) until you've worked at Esri for 6 years. That said, if you can boost the customer base and generate revenue, then you will have a bright future here. Don't expect a promotion, but expect that the company will keep you. But will you keep it? Redlands has about 60,000 people; it's a cute town. If you live in town, you will have a very short commute. Many people can walk to work in less than 20 minutes. Wear a hat and sunscreen.","Esri takes the ""E"" out of Environmental. Or both E's. This is a software company that hides behind it's name and pretty maps. The company will let you work yourself to the bone if you let it. 60+ hour work weeks were totally possible, depending on the tempo. Don't believe in the fantasy that Esri is the 'cream of the crop' in GIS. It often times doesn't seem like a GIS company; they could be selling beachballs or plastic forks. Much of their focus is an online version of GIS that can be manipulated by users that don't even know anything about GIS. If you think that non-cartographers should be making maps that influence policy and decision making, then you fit the Esri business model. If you're looking to use GIS skills, then you should look elsewhere. Very few people in this company need to be skilled in GIS. Your true skills will help you get a job here, but those skills along with your deeper passion for GIS will likely perish. But as I said, you're job here is to create customers, retain customers, and pretend that ESRI and GIS are synonyms. It's fantasy land for people who want to live a fantasy. That's applicable to the broader context of southern California, btw. The general population density of southern California is ridiculous; expect to experience a lot of competitive inconvenience based solely on the fact that more than 20 million people live in southern California. The landscape is better suited for lizards than for mammals, but because of abusive water rights the people are able to thrive. Let's see if that lasts during the 21st century. I only bring this up, because numerous locals took the time to tell me that growing up in a place like Redlands is the only way that you could ever think of a place like the greater Los Angeles area as normal. in order for Redlands to ever seem normal. These are all relevant parts of the job experience, right? Partying reigns supreme in southern California, but maybe that's what you're looking for. Not only is alcohol legal at just about every store in California, it's practically mandatory. You'll definitely learn your demons in southern California. Think twice before you cash in a different opportunity to come here, unless you're working a contract job in Afghanistan. It's better than that.","1.0

The company is perpetually listing new job positions; however, if you keep your on eye on them, they also never hire for them. Looks great on paper, but the reality is more of a silent hire freeze. The company strongly emphasizes education, which is excellent; however, they fail to recognize knowledge or common sense. This creates a very resentful work atmosphere when you have individuals who have a ""degree"" but know nothing about business practices, organization or basic technology supervising individuals that have extensive work experience and knowledge to offer but are continuously blown off for lack of a degree. As a contracted employee, you will be treated as inferior. Put a lot of work and thought in to projects and day to day work only to have my contract terminated after over a year. Don't expect to take a sick day, an extra long lunch (approved by management) to go to your child's award ceremony or get tied up in a traffic delay; it will be held against you as a contracted employee...even after being contracted for over a year.

Flex time. Very stable Paid overtime for ""salary"" workers","Very limited career growth possibilities - This is a largely flat corporate hierarchy. Everyone below director level is mostly equal. Titles and authority are not career based. Reorganizations in IT are frequent and people are moved up and down the structure arbitrarily. Success is based on seniority, not merit - ESRI is not a meritocracy. One's influence is related to the amount of time spent working there, or who you know. Success and experience are secondary to long-term personal relationships. No technological growth - ESRI uses very outdated technologies and is very skeptical to adopt anything new. New technologies threaten the comfort level of long term employees. Since seniority matters more than experience, any new technologies require serious uphill battles. An employee willing to make that case often ends up ostracized for threatening long term employees' positions. Employee monitoring by fellow employees - Employees are encouraged, and sometimes rewarded, for monitoring fellow employees and reporting activity to management. Old Guard of GIS - ESRI is successful for being the first and largest company in GIS. However, they are a desktop focused software product. They have failed to keep technologically relevant as companies like Google are rising to challenge them. Siloed Divisions - Individual divisions function in silos and directors regularly compete/challenge each other for the pool of resources. It is not uncommon to have different groups all doing the same thing but different ways. There is very little cooperation between business units. Lower pay - Expect salaries to stay below market price since you are compensated for overtime. The unspoken rule is that 45 hours/week is expected and brings your take home more closely aligned with market price. However, since there is no structure, there is no way to raise one's salary beyond 3-6%(-ish) a year for your entire career at ESRI. Paid overtime for salary workers - There is no leniency in time spent since all time is billable to the company. During orientation, you are told to remember to clock out for the 5-10 minute walk to get food from the cafeteria and back. That 10 minute period is personal time and is expected to be considered as such. For a contractor or hourly worker, this is not uncommon. However, a salary employee may find it challenging.","2.0

Plenty of opportunities to spend what little money you make on grossly over-priced food in the cafe. You can play with the feral cats on your way to and from your car.","This is not a business anymore. It is an academic ""Think Tank"" full of arrogant, self-centered managers who consider themselves the guardians of the planet. Sure, they are making money (that you as a common worker bee will never see) because they continue to upsell useless add-ons and services to their huge clients - who by the way are required to use only ESRI software and services because of the very restrictive contracts they were foolish enough to sign. But wait, it gets worse! The management level (particularly in the Marketing division) and the Corporate Administrative Services department warrant special attention. They're useless - gone (I wish)! I struggle to find words that adequately reflect how bad it is to come into contact with either of these two groups. Imagine touching the world's hottest stove. Now, imagine two of these stoves - one on each side and you are caught in the middle. Now, imagine these stoves converging to squeeze the life out of you. Got the picture? Then welcome to ESRI - abandon all hope. Seriously, if you are considering a job at this company - please reconsider. There is no structure here. If they give you a job spec - it is just a formality. You will have to do whatever they tell you - even if you aren't trained to do it. And you better do it well - or else you get an unwanted tour of the Corporate Administrative Services gulag. The ever-present deception starts at the interview. You will hear promises of good pay, flexible schedule, work-life balance, collaboration with colleagues, friendly work environment, etc, etc. ESRI is none of these things. There is an annual review process which is nothing more than a caning session for your morale. Don't believe me? Ask any worker bee whose gone through it more than once. And while your morale evaporates over the years, so will your savings account. It actually will cost you money to work at ESRI. The range of annual merit increases (the rest of humanity calls these raises) that you will be subject to is 0% to 5%. This is the party line, but actually it's more like 0% to 3%. So, if by some miracle you don't do anything all year (and well into the following year) to offend your department manager or direct supervisor (which is, by the way, impossible) you'll probably get a 3%. Since this is lower than the current Cost of Living Index, you actually just lost money working all year. Congrats!! I know several ESRI employees that have had to take second jobs to make ends meet. Remember: if what you hear about this company sounds too good to be true - that's a big red flag you need to take notice of.","1.0

There is no career development or opportunity for advancement. Understand that. None. Unless you’re willing to sacrifice 10 to 15 years of your professional life while earning a low salary to become “one of the gang.” Management is hit or miss. Don’t expect to interact with anyone in management other than your immediate supervisor. Esri has a very defined chain-of-command employees are expected to follow. The benefit of ""flexible"" work schedules mentioned on the web site is misleading. Good luck arranging something that works for you. Communication throughout the organization is very poor.

Customers appreciate and value the interaction with staff and you are given the opportunity to work with a wide array of organizations solving mission critical issues. Job Security Benefits package 401K,"Executive leadership tends to close itself off from the reality of what’s really happening in the industry. The competition in this industry is fierce, Google, Microsoft, not to mention partner “co-opetion”, but sales executive receive no compensation for their effort. Organizationally the company moves at a snail’s pace compared to the rest of the industry. Innovative thoughts and ideas are stifled by less creative mind in the organization which wield the power and influence to implement change. It’s easier for management to say no than yes, negating the negotiation process and preventing Sales people from closing business.

Sat Nov 19 2011 11:49:58 GMT+0900 (Korean Standard Time),,"Redlands, CA","Sales Representative in Redlands, CA",Excellent post-college GIS training for free. Poor career prospects. Fear HR.,I worked at Esri,"Esri truly has a beautiful campus. It was very refreshing to walk around all of the exotic trees and landscapes. This definitely added value to my daily routine. The company is located in Redlands which for a small town isn't that bad. Esri is the largest employer there. If you like to feel privileged then the effect of Esri being in Redlands lends to a ""big fish in a little pond"" kind of ego-boost for most Esri employees. If you're into that kind of thing then you'll enjoy working for Esri in Redlands as opposed to Esri in a remote office, where nobody local cares if you work for Esri or not. If you are a GIS enthusiast, working for Esri gives you a new perspective (vendor centric) on the whole industry that you won't get elsewhere. There are some great Esri internal presentations that occur periodically that aren't available to the public. You'll get to hear presentations before they go onto the big stages. It feels good knowing what's on the cutting edge of Esri technology and whats likely to happen next in the industry. Lots of free training available if you like tinkering with the technology. If you're a kool-aid drinker and thing that GIS will save the world then you will fit right in.","Low pay and poor benefits. Low 401k matching. Most kids out of college don't know what ""good benefits"" are. Esri hires a lot of recent graduates to keep up with their high turnover. At Esri, you'll notice a trend in employees. Usually you're either (A) a veteran who has been there forever or (B) a relatively new hire with less than 4 years at the company. Coincidentally, after 4 years your 401k is vested. I suspect that employees get ""pushed out"" just before that time and then replaced by a recent college graduate. HR. Don't even get me started. An event occurred a few years ago when the markets went sour. Esri hired new HR management to ""make things more efficient"". Instead being upfront and laying people off, they began finding extremely petty reasons to cite people for rule violations. Internet usage, phone usage, dress code, rules that nobody knew existed, etc. The result was that a lot of people got fired or were forced to resign. This event set a tone for how HR works at the company and has persisted until today. Backstabbing occurs at Esri when someone finds a way to build a case against you with HR, who will undoubtedly make your working life hellish. For example, you may be forced to attend an hour-long meeting with HR every other Monday to do performance reviews for the duration of 6-8 months. In these meetings, they will have all of your email correspondence printed and will review it with you, looking for ways to take your written word out of context and perpetuate their case against you. During this time your manager will tell you that HR has blocked your annual raise. They advertise a ""flat management style"" as a benefit. This is Esri's way of saying ""once you're hired we won't pay you more money for position moves later in your career"". Esri's biggest expense are salaries for their employees. They will fight you tooth and nail to keep your salary as low as possible. In actuality, the flat management style is just a myth. Esri is riddled with all different layers of management and bureaucracies once you cut through the smoke. The company isn't doing anything new anymore. Nothing revolutionary has happened since ArcView 3.x and they're still milking the GIS desktop cow. Esri server software and enterprise solutions are just bandwagon products that they had to create to remain relevant. The lack of recent product innovation has led to a penny-pinching culture where someone's cost-cutting initiatives are more valuable than innovative product engineering that should be taking place instead.","2.0

The exempt/non-exempt distinction between employees creates a demoralizing division, with non-exempt employees under a very strict schedule & managerial babysitting, and exempt employees free to largely determine their own schedules. Tenure at the company far outweighs job performance & industry expertise. Marketing strategies are decrepit and rigid, abd management is not open to incorporation of new ideas. Ample criticism for even minor errors that don't affect productivity & NO positive reinforcement for successes.","2.0
